# DeepPavlov Dream

**DeepPavlov Dream** is a platform for creating multi-skill chatbots.

To get architecture documentation, please refer to DeepPavlov Agent [readthedocs documentation](https://deeppavlov-agent.readthedocs.io).


# Distributions

We've already included five distributions: four of them are based on lightweight Deepy socialbot
and one is a full-sized Dream chatbot.

### Deepy Base
Base version of Lunar assistant. 
Deepy Base contains Spelling Preprocessing annotator,
template-based Harvesters Maintenance Skill,
and AIML-based open-domain Program-y Skill based on Dialog Flow Framework.

### Deepy Advanced
Advanced version of Lunar assistant. 
Deepy Advanced contains Spelling Preprocessing, Sentence Segmentation,
Entity Linking and Intent Catcher annotators, Harvesters Maintenance GoBot Skill for goal-oriented responses,
and AIML-based open-domain Program-y Skill based on Dialog Flow Framework.

### Deepy FAQ
FAQ version of Lunar assistant. 
Deepy FAQ contains Spelling Preprocessing annotator, 
template-based Frequently Asked Questions Skill,
and AIML-based open-domain Program-y Skill based on Dialog Flow Framework.

### Deepy GoBot
Goal-oriented version of Lunar assistant.
Deepy GoBot Base contains Spelling Preprocessing annotator,
Harvesters Maintenance GoBot Skill for goal-oriented responses,
and AIML-based open-domain Program-y Skill based on Dialog Flow Framework.

### Dream
Full version of DeepPavlov Dream Socialbot.
This is almost the same version of the DREAM socialbot as at 
[the end of Alexa Prize Challenge 4](https://d7qzviu3xw2xc.cloudfront.net/alexa/alexaprize/docs/sgc4/MIPT-DREAM.pdf).
Some API services are replaced with trainable models.
Some services (e.g., News Annotator, Game Skill, Weather Skill) require private keys for underlying APIs,
most of them can be obtained for free.
If you want to use these services in local deployments, add your keys to the environmental variables (e.g., `./.env`).
This version of Dream Socialbot consumes a lot of resources 
because of its modular architecture and original goals (participation in Alexa Prize Challenge). 
We provide a demo of Dream Socialbot on [our website](https://demo.deeppavlov.ai).


# Quick Start

### Clone the repo

```
git clone https://github.com/deepmipt/dream.git
```


### Install [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) 

If you get a "Permission denied" error running docker-compose, make sure to [configure your docker user](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/) correctly.


### Run one of the Dream distributions

#### **Deepy Base**
```
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f assistant_dists/deepy_base/docker-compose.override.yml up --build
```

#### **Deepy Advanced**
```
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f assistant_dists/deepy_adv/docker-compose.override.yml up --build
```

#### **Deepy FAQ**
```
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f assistant_dists/deepy_faq/docker-compose.override.yml up --build
```

#### **Deepy GoBot**
```
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f assistant_dists/deepy_gobot_base/docker-compose.override.yml up --build
```

#### **Dream (via proxy)**
The easiest way to try out Dream is to deploy it via proxy. 
All the requests will be redirected to DeepPavlov API, so you don't have to use any local resources.
See [proxy usage](#proxy-usage) for details.
```
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f assistant_dists/dream/docker-compose.override.yml -f assistant_dists/dream/proxy.yml up --build
```

#### **Dream (locally)**

**Please note, that DeepPavlov Dream components require a lot of resources.**
Refer to the [components](#components) section to see estimated requirements.
```
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f assistant_dists/dream/docker-compose.override.yml -f assistant_dists/dream/dev.yml up --build
```
We've also included a config with GPU allocations for multi-GPU environments.

```
AGENT_PORT=4242 docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f assistant_dists/dream/docker-compose.override.yml -f assistant_dists/dream/dev.yml -f assistant_dists/dream/test.yml up
```
When you need to restart particular docker container without re-building (make sure mapping in `assistant_dists/dream/dev.yml` is correct):
```
AGENT_PORT=4242 docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f assistant_dists/dream/docker-compose.override.yml -f assistant_dists/dream/dev.yml restart container-name
```

### Let's chat
In a separate terminal tab run:

```
docker-compose exec agent python -m deeppavlov_agent.run -pl assistant_dists/dream/pipeline_conf.json
```

Enter your username and have a chat with Dream!


### Let's talk via HTTP API
Once you've started the bot, DeepPavlov's Agent API will run on `http://localhost:4242'. You can learn about its API from the [DeepPavlov Agent Docs](https://deeppavlov-agent.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro/overview.html#http-api-server).

# Configuration and proxy usage
Dream uses several docker-compose configuration files:

`./docker-compose.yml` is the core config which includes containers for DeepPavlov Agent and mongo database;

`./assistant_dists/*/docker-compose.override.yml` lists all components for the distribution; 

`./assistant_dists/dream/dev.yml` includes volume bindings for easier Dream debugging;

`./assistant_dists/dream/proxy.yml` is a list of proxied containers.

If your deployment resources are limited, you can replace containers with their proxied copies hosted by DeepPavlov.
To do this, override those container definitions inside `proxy.yml`, e.g.:
```
convers-evaluator-annotator:
  command: ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
  build:
    context: dp/proxy/
    dockerfile: Dockerfile
  environment:
    - PROXY_PASS=dream.deeppavlov.ai:8004
    - PORT=8004
```
and include this config in your deployment command:

```
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f assistant_dists/dream/docker-compose.override.yml -f assistant_dists/dream/proxy.yml up --build
```

By default, `proxy.yml` contains all available proxy definitions.

## Report creating
For making certification `xlsx` - file with bot responses, you can use `xlsx_responder.py` script by executing
```shell
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f dev.yml exec -T -u $(id -u) agent python3 \
        utils/xlsx_responder.py --url http://0.0.0.0:4242 \
        --input 'tests/dream/test_questions.xlsx' \
        --output 'tests/dream/output/test_questions_output.xlsx'\
      --cache tests/dream/output/test_questions_output_$(date --iso-8601=seconds).json
```
Make sure all services are deployed. `--input` - `xlsx` file with certification questions, `--output` - `xlsx` file with bot responses, `--cache` - `json`, that contains a detailed markup and is used for a cache.
