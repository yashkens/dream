It is located in the Khumbu region of Mahalangur Himalaya and is among one of the surrounding mountains of Everest. First climbed in 1961 by Dennis Davis and Sherpa Tashi, Nuptse is 20th on our list of highest mountain peaks in the world.  19. Distaghil Sar, Hispar Karakoram Located in the Karakoram range of Gilgit-Baltistan region of Pakistan, Distaghil Sar is about 7884 m high and almost 3 km wide. It was climbed in 1960 by G\u00fcnther St\u00e4rker and Diether Marchar who were part of an Austrian expedition team. It is the highest peak in its own range i.e. Hispar Muztagh.  18. Himalchuli, Manaslu Himalaya Himalchuli peak is a part of Nepalese Himalayas and lies south of Manaslu, which is one of the highest peaks in the world. With a height of 7894 m, Himalchuli is the second highest peak in its own mountain range i.e. Mansiri Himalaya. It saw its first successful ascent in 1960 when Hisashi Tanabe of Japan climbed it.  17. Gasherbrum IV, Baltoro Karakoram Gasherbrum IV, as the name suggests, is one of the peaks in the Gasherbrum mountain ranges which are located in Pakistan. It is a part of the north-east end of the Baltoro Glacier in the Karakoram range of the Himalaya. Gasherbrum is an Urdu word which means \u201cShining wall\u201d. The other 3 peaks located in Gasherbrum mountains are well above 8000 m while this one is about 7932 m high.  16. Annapurna II, Annapurna Himalaya Annapurna peaks are part of the Annapurna mountain ranges which form a major part of the Himalayan ranges. About 7934 m high, Annapurna II lies in the eastern ranges of the Annapurna ranges and quite contrary to what people believe, is an independent peak. It was first climbed by Richard Grant, Chris Bonington and Sherpa Ang Nyima in 1960 and has since seen very few ascents.  15. Gyanchung Kang, Mahalangur Himalaya Gyanchung Kang lies between two of the highest mountains in the world, both of which are above 8000 m, i.e. Cho Oyu and Everest. Part of Mahalangur Himalaya, it spreads between the borders of Nepal and China. First climbed in 1964 by Japanese, Gyanchung Kang marks an important point in our list as it is the highest mountain in the world which is below 8000 m. It\u2019s 7952m high.  14. Shishapangma, Jugal Himalaya We now enter the elite club in mountain peaks as all the peaks listed from here on have a height of more than 8000m ! Shishapangma maybe the lowest of all 8000 m peaks but that doesn\u2019t make it easy to climb. Located between Tibet and China, it lies in the restricted area where foreigners are not allowed to visit due to administrative reasons. The 8027 m high peak got its name from Tibetan dialect in which Shishapangma means \u201ccrest above the grassy palins.\u201d  13. Gasherbrum II/K4, Baltoro Karakoram As stated above, Gasherbrum II is located in the Karakoram range and lies above Gasherbrum III. The 8035 m high peak was first climbed by Austrian climbers in 1956. Gasherbrum II is also popularly known as K4 which implies that it is the fourth mountain in the Karakoram ranges.   12. Broad Peak / K3, Baltoro Karakoram At 8051 m, Broad Peak or as it is popularly known among the locals, Falchan Kangri, K3 is the 12th highest peak on our list. It bears some very harsh conditions around it and climbing for most part of the year is near to impossible in these ranges.  11. Gasherbrum I /Hidden Peak / K5, Baltoro Karakoram The fifth peak of the Karakoram range K5 got another name in the late 20th century that was \u201cHidden peak\u201d because of the extreme remoteness it was located in. The 8,080 m high peak was first climbed in 1956 by Pete Schoening and Andy Kauffman who were a part of an 8 member American expedition.  10. Annapurna I, Annapurna Himalaya As we get into the top 10, the height of the peaks keeps getting taller and number of successful ascents smaller. The Annapurna main or Annapurna I is the tenth highest mountain in the world with a height of 8,091 m. Annapurna gets its name from the Sanskrit word which means \u201cfull of food\u201d.  9. Nanga Parbat, Nanga Parbat Himalaya Locally known as Deo-mir, Nanga Parbat is about 8,126 m high and is located in the Gilgit-Baltistan region of Pakistan. It is also called by the name of \u201cKiller mountain\u201d as it has seen one of the highest number of unsuccessful expedition attempts and has never been climbed in winter.  8. Manaslu, Manaslu Himalaya Manaslu comes from the Sanskrit word \u2018Manas\u2019 which means \u201cintellect\u201d or \u201csoul\u201d. It is located in the Lamjung district of Himalaya and is very close to Annapurna range. It is 8,163 m high. A Manaslu Conservation area has also been set up around it for sustainable and environmental purposes.  7. Dhaulagiri I, Dhaulagiri Himalaya The Dhaulagiri mountains spread across more than 100s of Km from the Kalingandaki river in Ganges to Bheri river in Nepal. One of its peaks, Dhaulagiri I is about 8,167 m high and is the 7th highest mountain in the world.

With a height of 8,611 m, K2 is popularly known as the savage mountain due to the sheer difficulty it poses to those who attempt to climb it. In fact, it has seen one of the lowest number of successful ascents and has never been climbed in winters.  1. Mount Everest /Sagarmatha /Chomolungma, Mahalangur Himalaya  And now after an arduous journey of 19 mountains, we have finally reached the top of the world, Mt. Everest or Sagarmatha as it is known in Nepal or Chomolungma as it is known in Tibet. It was first discovered in 1802 and saw its first successful attempt in 1953 when Edmund Hillary and Tenzin Norge climbed it.

The outward pressure of gas heated by fusion is balanced by the inward pull of gravity, leaving the star in hydrostatic equilibrium. This balance of forces lasts for most of a star\u2019s life, maintaining its steady temperature. Radiation and convection carry the energy from the core out through a star\u2019s atmosphere. When the energy gets high enough in the atmosphere that the region above it is transparent, it escapes out into space as light of all wave- lengths, as well as stellar wind. Though stars may appear static, they rotate and vary in luminosity."

If you\u2019re short on time or prefer not to work with fresh shrimp, buy them pre-cooked at your local grocery store. You\u2019ll find them in the frozen seafood section. Be sure to thaw frozen, pre-cooked shrimp before you begin.  Cut each shrimp into 2 to 3 pieces with a sharp knife. If you like chunky salad, cut each shrimp into about 2 pieces. If you like a smoother consistency, cut them into 3 to 4 pieces. If you\u2019re working with jumbo shrimp, you may want to cut them in 5 to 6 pieces. Place the shrimp pieces in a large bowl.  Chop up the crab meat into chunks. Aim for chunks of crab meat that are about the same size as your shrimp pieces so your salad will be consistent. Place the crab meat chunks in the large bowl with the chopped shrimp. This recipe calls for imitation crab meat, which is very common for recipes that call for a large amount of crab meat. Imitation crab meat is still made of seafood, though!  Add the chopped veggies, mayo and seasonings to the bowl. Finely chop the celery and onion with a sharp knife. Add the veggies to the large bowl with the seafood. Measure out the mayo and place it in the bowl. Season with black pepper, MSG, salt, and garlic salt. Stir well to combine the ingredients.  Cover the bowl and chill the salad for 4 hours. Place a lid or plastic wrap on top of the bowl. Place the seafood salad in the fridge and let it chill for about 4 hours. During this time, the flavors will blend and set. Give the mixture another stir before serving. Serve the seafood salad with crackers or sandwich bread. Seafood salad makes a great dip when served with crackers or pita bread. You can also serve seafood salad as a sandwich filling. Use a crusty French bread or hoagie style buns. Store leftovers in the fridge and consume within 2 days.[3]  Bring 4 quarts (3.8 l) of water to a boil. Place the water in a large pot and add 1 teaspoon of salt. Turn the heat to high and bring the water to a rolling boil. This usually takes about 10 to 15 minutes. Add the uncooked pasta to the boiling water. Make sure that all of the pasta is fully submerged. Boil the pasta uncovered according to the package instructions. Cook times will vary, depending on the pasta type. If you like your pasta firm (al dente), it usually only needs to cook for about 1 minute. Otherwise, it will take somewhere between 8 and 12 minutes. You can use any kind of small pasta for this recipe, such as macaroni, rotini, small shells, bowties, and so on."
