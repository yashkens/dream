With chagrin, I leave just a little bacon grease in the pan. Then I get ahold of myself, crack in two eggs and fry them until yolks are medium firmness. Next I top eggs with cheese ans flip the eggs once the cheese melts.Finally, I slide out my creation onto a plate and douse it with cayenne pepper, Tabasco, and a dash of ketchup. Delicious!", "question": "What  do you prefer for braekfast?"},
    "movie": {"name": "harry potter", "story": "Sometimes I need to watch some fantasy to feel relaxed and lift my mood. Harry Potter movies take me to a different world when I watch them.

Their school activities are really amusing and magical.", "question": "What was the last good movie you watched?"},
    "book": {"name": "the catcher in the rye", "story": "It's believable. Holden was different and had some flaws so it was a different type of book. His true companion was his sister and she made him to return home. I always wondered about the future of the character.

    "tv show": {"name": "gossip girl", "story": "I started watching Gossip girl a few months ago. And it turned out to be the perfect mix of drama, romance, comedy and everything an amazing series needs.

    "sport": {"name": "soccer", "story": "I have learned so much from soccer throughout the years. The things I have learned through soccer, I don’t think I would have learned them anywhere else. For example, through soccer, I know almost all the countries and cities in them. I know places like Zurich, Leicester, Liverpool, Munich, and Shrewsbury. I know these places because when you watch soccer, especially European soccer, you get to listen to a lot of analytical thought on teams that come from these places. Listening to experienced commentators during the soccer matches also helped improve my vocabulary. Once I was asked a question about a word I heard a commentator use in a match the week before so I could easily explain the meaning.", "question": "What kind of sports are you fond of?"},

    "all time favorite movie": {"name": "avengers endgame", "story": "Endgame was everything I hoped it would be. I cheered, laughed, got angry, stressed, irritated, and cried multiple times. I liked that heroes got worthy, if not always happy, endings. Natasha died — but in a way that guaranteed her ledger was back in the black. Tony died — but he died making the sacrifice play that once wasn’t in him to make, fixing the biggest damn problem ever set him. Clint got his family back. Bruce finally got his life and peace of mind back. Thor saved his people — okay, some of them. A few. And after everything he’s done for us, who’s going to begrudge Cap’s getting the happy ending he deserves?", "question": "What is your all time favorite movie?"},

    "anime": {"name": "Dr. Stone", "story": "Most shows in a survival setting focus on the drama, or make it a complete comedy. Dr.Stone how ever fuses them together, it's more on the comedic side but it emphasis on some of the more intricate fundamentals of surviving to bring out the shows emotions, comfort, teamwork, morale, cunning and passing of information, all that together makes for a great foundation for each of these characters in the main cast to interact with each other and show off what they're about. The setting also works perfect for naturally opening plenty of opportunity for jokes and a verity of funny interactions from different match ups of characters, referencing memes and creating new ones, while trying to navigate and bring civilization back in to this new world, keeping the show a pretty entertaining through out. They’re all mostly archetypal but they have enough of their own identity to not be flat or stale.", "question": "What about you? What anime do you watch?"}
