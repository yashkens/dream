To handle such a diet, manatees are hindgut digesters (like horses) and have intestines as long as 30 meters (100 feet).",

Here are some interesting facts about this blue gas (and ice) gian",
        "The beautiful blue color of Uranus is due to a large amount of Methane gas present in Uranus's atmosphere. Methane has a unique property of absorbing red light and scattering away blue light. That's why Uranus looks greenish-blue",
        "One rotation of Uranus about its axis takes 17.9 Earth hours, and one complete revolution of Uranus around the Sun takes 84 Earth years",
        "Because of its unique tilt, each pole of Uranus gets around 42 years of continuous sunlight, followed by 42 years of darkness. So, if you want to spend the rest of your life in darkness/brightness, Uranus is your address",
        "Uranus is nicknamed as the \"ice giant.\" Uranus gained this name as it is chiefly composed of heavier volatile substance like Ammonia and Hydrogen Sulfide. These volatile substances along with water vapor create an icy cloud over Uranus due to which Uranus appears to have the pale blue color",

        "It takes Uranus 84 Earth years to orbit the Sun. Its axis is at 98 degrees, which means it almost lies sideways as it orbits the Sun. This means that the north and south poles of Uranus lie near where the equator is on Earth. During parts of its orbit one or other of the poles directly face the Sun which means the planet gets around 42 years of direct sunlight followed by 42 years of darkness.",
        "A collision may have caused the unusual tilt of Uranus. The theory is that an Earth-sized planet may have collided with Uranus which forced its axis to drastically shift.",

They're also narrow, only measuring a few km wide. Astronomers think that the rings of Uranus are very young, and probably formed relatively recently, and not with the planet.",

        "The mass of Jupiter equates to the mass of 317 Earths! Also, Jupiter is so huge that when lined up in a straight line, it would take about 11 Earth to reach from one end of Jupiter to another. You can fit about 1300 Earth inside Jupiter. Isn't Jupiter huge",

        "Even though Jupiter orbits very slowly around the sun, yet it is the fastest spinning planet in the entire Solar System. One rotation of Jupiter about its axis takes a mere 10 hours! It is rotating so fast that the planet has started to bulge at equator while flattening out at other places",

One of the entries has been listed as natural heritage and the others are cultural heritage sites.",
        "The regional cuisine of Lombardy is heavily based upon ingredients like rice, beef, pork, butter, and lard. Despite being a form of Italian cuisine, Lombard food, even more than other cuisine of Northern Italy, tends to have little in common with Central or Southern Italian styles, in many cases lacking the presence of tomato and olive oil, being more meat-based and buttery. In many aspects, Lombard cuisine has much in common with that of Austria and central Europe in general with dishes such as Milanese scallop, Sp\u00e4tzle and Spezzatino also known as Goulash."
