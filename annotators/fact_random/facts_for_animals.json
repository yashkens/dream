        "The lifespan of aardvarks is up to 18 years in the wild and up to 23 years in captivity.",
        "An aardvark's weight is typically between 60 and 80 kilograms (130\u2013180 lb). An aardvark's length is usually between 105 and 130 centimeters (3.4 and 4.3 ft), and can reach lengths of 2.2 meters (7 ft 3 in) when its tail (which can be up to 70 centimeters (28 in)) is taken into account. It is 60 centimeters (24 in) tall at the shoulder, and has a girth of about 100 centimeters (3.3 ft).",
        "Aardvarks have very thick skin and do not possess a fat layer. The thickness of the skin protects these animals from biting ants, and aardvarks may sleep in the ant nests they have recently excavated for feeding.",
        "While aardvarks have teeth (unlike other anteaters), they lack incisors and canines.",
        "The aardvark is nocturnal and is a solitary creature that feeds almost exclusively on ants and termites which it will dig out of their hills using its sharp claws and powerful legs. It can eat up to 50 thousands insects each night; the only fruit eaten by aardvarks is the aardvark cucumber.",
        "The running speed of an aardvark has not been officially documented but it is estimated to be able to run at speeds of which is around 38-42 km/h (23.5-26 mph).",
        "The aardvark is known to be a good swimmer and has been witnessed successfully swimming in strong currents.",
        "The aardvark excavates branching burrows, usually 2 to 3 meters (6.6 to 9.8 feet) long but sometimes up to 13 meters (42.6 feet), with several sleeping chambers. It abandons old burrows and digs new ones frequently, which thereby provides dens used by other species such as the African wild dog.",
        "The aardvark is a rather quiet animal. However, it does make soft grunting sounds as it forages and loud grunts as it makes for its tunnel entrance.",
        "The aardvark is currently listed as a species of least concern, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species.",
        "The aardvark is sometimes colloquially called \"African ant bear\", \"anteater\" (not to be confused with the South American anteater), or the \"Cape anteater\" after the Cape of Good Hope.",
        "The name \"aardvark\" comes from earlier Afrikaans (erdvark) and means \"earth pig\" or \"ground pig\", because of its burrowing habits.",
        "Aardvarks handle captivity well. The first zoo to have one was London Zoo in 1869, which had an animal from South Africa.",
        "In African folklore, the aardvark is much admired because of its diligent quest for food and its fearless response to soldier ants.",

        "However, the origin of the Abyssinian is shrouded in mystery. Early cat books do not shed much light on the history of this breed because there were few or no records kept.",
        "It was thought that the first cat was brought to England by a British soldier, in 1868, after the English army had fought in Abyssinia (present day Ethiopia). It is believed that this cat, named \"Zula\" is the founder of the Abyssinian line.",
        "It was not until the 1930s that show-quality Abyssinians were exported from England \u2013 these cats form the basis of modern day breeding programs in America.",
        "World War II almost wiped out the Abyssinian cat population in the UK and a concerted effort was made to import Abyssinians from the US to bolster the breeding population.",
        "Since then, Abyssinian populations have grown rapidly and they've become one of the most popular cat breeds in the world.",
        "The Abyssinian cat has a typical lifespan of 9 to 15 years.",
        "The typical Abyssinian cat has an overall height of 20 to 25 cm (8 to 10 in) and body length of 30 to 41 cm (12 to 16). An average Abyssinian cat weighs between 4 and 5 kg (8 to 12 lb).",
        "The Abyssinian is a lithe cat with relatively slender legs and a long, tapering tail.",
        "Abyssinians are a popular breed thanks in large part to their unusual intelligence and generally extroverted, playful, willful personalities.",
        "With their interest in playing with their owners combined with their curious intelligence, Abyssinians are known as the \"Clowns of the Cat Kingdom\".",
        "In appearance, the Abyssinian kitten is basically a miniature adult. They tend to grow at an average rate and reach mature height at about 6 months, filling out and maturing to full size and weight at about one year old.",
        "Abyssinian kittens from recognized breeders will usually cost $1200 to $2200. Kittens with premium lineages, coming from famous breeders, will have a price, about $2200 to $5000.",
        "Abyssinian cats are one of the most popular short haired breeds found in the United States today.",
        "Somali cats are the same genetic stock as Abyssinians but are recessive for a gene responsible for long-hair."

        "An aristocratic breed of hound dog, the Afghan hound was developed as a hunter in the hill country of Afghanistan, where it hunts by sight and has been used to pursue leopards and gazelles.",
        "Afghan hounds are considered one of nine ancient or \"basal\" breeds, meaning their DNA is more closely related to the dogs of ancient history than common contemporary breeds.",
        "It is hard to pin down exactly when the Afghan hound first appeared, as its presence predates written history \u2013 however one of the first published descriptions of the breed appeared in a drawing by English soldier Thomas Duer Broughton when he was in India in 1809.",
        "The Afghan hound was brought to Europe in the late 19th century by British soldiers returning from the Indian-Afghan border wars.",
        "In the mid-1920s, British military officers began bringing Afghan hounds to the West, and in 1927, the breed was registered by the American Kennel Club (AKC).",
        "The beauty of Afghan Hound dogs caused them to become highly desirable show dogs and pets.",
        "An Afghan hound was featured on the cover of Life Magazine, November 26 1945.",
        "Although seldom used today for hunting in Europe and America, where they are popular, Afghan Hounds are frequent participants in lure coursing events and are also popular in the sport of conformation showing.",
        "Afghan Hounds have scent glands that usually produce a musky but not malodorous scent.",
        "Their long, fine-textured coat requires considerable care and grooming. The long topknot and the shorter-haired saddle on the back of the dog are distinctive features of the Afghan Hound coat. The high hipbones and unique small ring on the end of the tail are also characteristics of the breed.",
        "Because of its distinctive appearance, the Afghan hound has been represented in animated feature films and TV shows, including Universal Pictures' Balto (Sylvie) and Disney's Lady and the Tramp II: Scamp's Adventure (Ruby), an Afghan hound also appeared on 101 Dalmatians as well as in 102 Dalmatians.",
        "Afghan hounds have also been featured in television advertisements and in fashion magazines.",
        "Afghan hound puppies from the normal breeding farms will cost between $2 thousands and $2500 per puppy. They usually have normal family records so they are mainly raised as pets. Afghan hound puppies from prestigious breeding farms will cost much higher, around $2500 to $5500."

        "The African bush elephant is the largest and heaviest land animal on Earth, being up to 3.96 m (13 ft) tall at the shoulder and an estimated weight of up to 10.4 t (11.5 short tons).",
        "The African bush elephant has creased grey skin that can be up to 2.5 centimeters (1 inch) thick on some parts of its body. And even though it's thick, an elephant's skin is also very sensitive to touch and sunburn. It is so sensitive that it can feel a fly landing on it.",
        "Both sexes have tusks, which erupt when they are 1\u20133 years old and grow throughout life. The longest known tusk of an African bush elephant measured 3.51 m (11.5 ft) and weighed 117 kg (258 lb).",
        "The African bush elephant have the largest brain of any land animal, and three times as many neurons as humans. The brain of an elephant weighs 4.5 to 5.5 kg (10 to 12 lb) compared to 1.6 kg (4 lb) for a human brain. While the elephant brain is larger overall, it is proportionally smaller.",
        "African bush elephants generally are slow moving creatures. Their regular pace is 6 km/h (4 mph) but, they can reach speeds of up to 24 km/h (15 mph) when running.",
        "How much they travel each day depends on the amount of resources in close proximity that they require. The average walking distance for African bush elephants is around 10 km (6 mi) a day. When resources are scarce, African bush elephants may travel as much as 40 km (25 mi) a day.",
        "Due to their size, African bush elephants are not easy prey for many predators. While lions, African wild dogs, hyenas, and Nile crocodiles are predators of African bush elephants, the majority of these predators prey on the young elephants that lag behind the rest of their group.",
        "Until recently, the African forest elephant was considered to be a subspecies of the African bush elephant, but new research discovered that they are actually a separate species entirely."

        "The lifespan of the African forest elephant is between 60 and 70 years.",
        "The African forest elephant is the smallest of the three living elephant species.",
        "African forest elephants have a grey skin, which looks yellow to reddish after wallowing. They have sensitive skin and can be prone to sunburn, especially when young. Their wrinkled skin also helps in keeping them cool because water is trapped in the cracks and crevices, which then evaporates.",
        "The African forest elephant's tusks are straight and point downwards. Both male and female African elephants have tusks. The tusks are used to push through the dense undergrowth of their habitat. Their tusks can grow to about 1.5 meter (5 feet) long and can weigh between 50 and 100 lb (23 and 45 kg).",
        "The African forest elephant lives in family groups of up to 20 individuals. Family members look after calves together, called allomothering.",
        "African forest elephants are herbivorous, their diet is composed mainly of fruit, leaves, bark, and twigs of rainforest trees. To supplement their diet with minerals, they congregate at mineral-rich waterholes and mineral licks.",
        "African forest elephants have an extremely slow birth rate, putting them under greater pressure from poaching, research suggests. Scientists have found that the animals start to breed at a later age and with longer intervals between calves than other elephant species.",
        "Until recently, the African forest elephant was considered to be a subspecies of the African bush elephant, but new research discovered that they are actually a separate species entirely.",
        "African forest elephants are estimated to constitute up to one-third of the continent's elephant population, but have been poorly studied because of the difficulty in observing them through the dense vegetation that makes up their habitat."

        "African penguins have a black stripe and black spots on the chest, the pattern of spots being unique for every penguin, like human fingerprints. The white and black plumage serves as camouflage to predators, with the white appearing to aquatic predators from below and the black appearing to aerial predators from above.",
        "The pink gland above their eyes helps them to cope with changing temperatures. When the temperature gets hotter, the body of the African penguin sends more blood to these glands to be cooled by the air surrounding it. This then causes the gland to turn a darker shade of pink.",
        "African penguins forage in the open sea, where they pursue pelagic fish such as sardines and anchovies and marine invertebrates such as squid and small crustaceans. A penguin may consume up to 540 grams (19 ounce) of prey every day, but this may increase to over 1 kg (2.2 lb) when raising older chicks.",
        "African penguins can swim up to 20 km/h (12.5 mph) and can travel 30 to 70 km (18.5 to 43.5 mi) during each trip. They spend the night gathered together on shore and much of the day feeding in the water.",
        "When penguins molt, they are unable to forage as their new feathers are not yet waterproof; therefore, they fast over the entire molting period, which in African penguins takes around three weeks.",
        "Predators of African penguins include sharks and fur seals. While nesting, gulls, mongooses, caracals, Cape genets and domestic cats may prey on the penguins and their chicks.",

        "The adult plumage of most of the albatrosses is usually some variation of dark upper-wing and back with white undersides, often compared to that of a gull. Three albatross species, the black-footed albatross and the two sooty albatrosses, vary completely from the usual patterns and are almost entirely dark brown.",
        "Albatrosses have strong body, longish hooked bills, elongated legs and webbed feet.",
        "All albatrosses are very good at flying, spending much of their life in the air.",
        "Rather than flapping their wings to provide lift as most birds do, they glide on air currents. They use their formidable wingspans to ride the ocean winds and sometimes to glide for hours without rest or even a flap of their wings. When their wings are fully extended, they are locked into place by a tendon so that the albatross does not have to expend energy keeping its wings outstretched.",
        "A common assumption is that albatrosses must be able to sleep in flight, although no direct evidence has ever been obtained.",
        "At times the albatross will float on the sea's surface, though the position makes them vulnerable to aquatic predators.",

        "Albatrosses have no problem drinking sea water. The salt they take in is absorbed and moves through their blood stream into a pair of salt glands above their eyes. The densely salty fluid is excreted from the nostrils and runs down grooves in the bill. As the drop gets larger, the bird shakes its head to send the salt back to the ocean.",
        "Albatrosses are colonial, nesting for the most part on remote oceanic islands, often with several species nesting together. Pair bonds between males and females form over several years, with the use of \"ritualised dances\", and will last for the life of the pair.",
        "The single large white egg, laid on the bare ground or in a heaped-up nest, is incubated by the parents in turn. Incubation lasts around 70 to 80 days (longer for the larger albatrosses), the longest incubation period of any bird.",
        "Albatross chicks take a long time to fledge (learn how to fly). In the case of more bigger albatrosses, it can take up to 280 days.",
        "Albatross does not have a lot of natural enemies. Besides humans, main predator is tiger shark which hunts young birds that are learning to fly.",

        "Though often confused with various crocodile species, the American alligator can be distinguished by its rounded snout, and by the fact that when the jaws are closed, none of the lower teeth are visible. The body is armoured with thick scales, and bears a long, powerful tail, as well as sturdy limbs with webbed toes, which help to propel this species through the water. The eyes and snout are positioned on the top of the head, enabling the American alligator to breathe and watch for prey, while the rest of the body is submerged.",
        "The Chinese alligator differs from its American counterpart in subtle ways. It's smaller, the head is more robust and its snout is slightly upturned. The eyelids of the Chinese alligator have a bony plate that is missing in the American alligator. The American alligator also lacks the bony belly plates, or osteoderms, of the Chinese alligator.",
        "Adult alligators are black or dark olive-brown with white undersides, while juveniles have strongly contrasting white or yellow marks which fade with age.",

        "Alligators have extremely strong jaw muscles, which enable them to bite and grip their prey.",
        "The eyes of a large alligator will glow red and those of a smaller will glow green when a light is shined on them. This fact can be used to find alligators in the dark.",
        "Alligators are nocturnal creatures, which means they are more active at night. Primarily they do their hunting during this time as well; usually around dusk or sometime during the night. They carry out the process of hunting by laying motionless and waiting for their prey.",
        "Alligators are opportunistic feeders, eating almost anything they can catch. When young, alligators eat fish, insects, snails, crustaceans, and worms. As they mature, progressively larger prey is taken, including larger fish such as gar, turtles, and various mammals, particularly coypu and muskrat, as well as birds, deer, and other reptiles. Their stomachs also often contain gizzard stones.",
        "Large male alligators are solitary, territorial reptiles. Smaller alligators can often be found in large numbers in close proximity to each other. The largest of the species (both males and females), will defend prime territory whereas smaller alligators have a higher tolerance of other alligators within a similar size class.",
        "The mating season is in late spring. In April and May, alligators form so-called \"bellowing choruses\". Large groups of animals bellow together for a few minutes a few times a day, usually one to three hours after sunrise.",

Historically, hunting had decimated their population, and the American alligator was listed as an endangered species by the Endangered Species Act of 1973. Subsequent conservation efforts have allowed their numbers to increase and the species was removed from the list in 1987.",
        "Alligators are raised commercially for their meat and their skin, which is used for bags and shoes. They also provide economic benefits through the ecotourism industry.

They have a split upper lip (like a rabbit) which enables them to cleverly nibble around long and sharp thorns. Their diet is similar to a goat, although they chew their cud like a cow, and their digestive system is somewhere between a horse and a cow. In addition to green plants and grass, they enjoy meadow and lucerne hay.",

They start developing their colours at the age of 1 week if they have a dark colour (as seal-point) and at the age of 14 days, or more, if they have a clear colour (as lilac-point). The first part which develops the colour are the points of ears, nose and tail. The real colour is complete at two years old and after a wintry season.",

Youngsters stay close to Mom for several years while they grow and learn how to be a part of bonobo society. The mother gives birth every five to six years, allowing her time to bond with each offspring.",
        "Along with the common chimpanzee, the bonobo is the closest extant relative to humans. Because the two species are not proficient swimmers, the formation of the Congo River 1.5\u20132 million years ago possibly led to the speciation of the bonobo.",

        "The name \"bonobo\" first appeared in 1954, when Eduard Paul Tratz and Heinz Heck proposed it as a new and separate generic term for pygmy chimpanzees. The name is thought to be a misspelling on a shipping crate from the town of Bolobo on the Congo River, which was associated with the collection of chimps in the 1920s. The term has also been reported as being a word for \"ancestor\" in an extinct Bantu language."

That number increases for dogs with superior lineage. A top-quality dog with exceptional breed lines can cost $1 thousands-$4 thousands.",
        "Boston Terriers are expensive because they are relatively rare. While they are super common in some parts of the USA and the world, they are extremely rare in others. This causes the prices to go up significantly.",
        "With a short, shiny, smooth coat, Boston Terriers require little grooming. Bostons produce light shedding, and weekly brushing of their fine coat is effective at removing loose hair."

        "Bottlenose dolphins have a lifespan of about 40 to 50 years. Females typically live 5-10 years longer than males, with some females exceeding 60 years.",
        "Bottlenose dolphins range in lengths from 2 to 4 meters (6.6 to 13.1 ft) and weight from 150 to 650 kilograms (330 to 1 thousands lb).",
        "Bottlenose dolphins have a sleek, streamlined, fusiform body.",
        "Bottlenose dolphins seem to be always smiling because of the slight upturn to the corner of their mouths.",
        "Bottlenose dolphins are grey, varying from dark grey at the top near the dorsal fin to very light grey and almost white at the underside. This countershading makes them hard to see; When viewed from above, a dolphin's dark back surface blends with the murky depths. When seen from below, a dolphin's lighter belly blends with the bright sea surface.",
        "Bottlenose dolphins are super swimmers, gliding through the water using their curved dorsal fin on their back, a powerful tail and pointed flippers.",
        "The bottlenose dolphin typically rises to the surface to breathe through its blowhole two to three times per minute, although it can remain submerged for up to 20 minutes.",
        "The deepest dive ever recorded for a bottlenose dolphin was 300 meters (990 feet) by Tuffy, a bottlenose dolphin trained by the US Navy.",
        "Bottlenose dolphins hear tones with a frequency up to 160 kHz with the greatest sensitivity ranging from 40 to 100 kHz. The average hearing range for humans is about 0.02 to 20 kHz.",
        "Bottlenose dolphins have acute vision both in and out of the water. A dolphin's eye is particularly adapted for seeing under water.",
        "Bottlenose dolphins live in groups typically of 10\u201330 members, called pods, but group size varies from single individuals up to more than 1 thousands.",
        "Bottlenose dolphins communicate with each other in different ways. They squeak and whistle and use body language\u2014leaping as high as 6 meters (20 feet) in the air, snapping their jaws, slapping their tails on the surface of the water, and even butting heads.",
        "A bottlenose dolphin's diet consists mainly of fish, squid and crustaceans. An adult dolphin may eat 7 \u2013 13.5 kilograms (15 \u2013 30 pounds) of food each day.",
        "Bottlenose Dolphins often work as a team to harvest fish schools, but they also hunt individually. They search for prey primarily using echolocation.",
        "Bottlenose dolphins may breed throughout the year. Male and female bottlenose dolphins have multiple mates in a given reproductive season.",
        "Some large shark species, such as the tiger shark, the dusky shark, the great white shark and the bull shark, prey on the bottlenose dolphin, especially calves.",
        "The bottlenose dolphin is capable of defending itself by charging the predator; dolphin 'mobbing' behavior of sharks can occasionally prove fatal for the shark.",
        "While bottlenose dolphins are not categorized as endangered by the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, they are undoubtedly at risk from the commercial fishing industry and habitat destruction.",
        "Bottlenose dolphins have the second largest encephalization levels (the amount of brain mass related to an animal's total body mass) of any mammal on Earth (humans have the largest), which more than likely contributes to their incredibly high intelligence and emotional intelligence.",
        "Research suggests that bottlenose dolphins are self-aware, a trait which is considered to be a sign of highly-developed, abstract thinking. One such indicator is that they have been shown to be able to recognise themselves in a mirror.",
        "Bottlenose dolphins have the longest social memories of any nonhuman species. They have been shown to recognize the unique whistles of individual dolphins they once associated with some 20 years after becoming separated from them.",

        "Brown bears can be found in many habitats, from the fringes of deserts to high mountain forests and ice fields. In Europe, the brown bear is mostly found in mountain woodlands, in Siberia it occurs primarily in forests while in North America they prefer tundra, alpine meadows and coastlines. The species' main requirements are areas with dense cover in which they can shelter by day.",
        "There are 16 subspecies of brown bears including grizzly bears and Kodiak bears.",
        "The brown bear is a naturally long-lived animal. The average lifespan in the wild is about 25 years. The oldest wild brown bear on record was nearly 37 years old. The oldest brown bear in captivity have been verified to live up to 47 years, with one captive male possibly attaining 50 years of age.",
        "The brown bear is one of the two largest terrestrial carnivorans alive today, rivaled in body size only by its close cousin, the polar bear (Ursus maritimus), which is much less variable in size and averages larger due to this.",
        "The size of brown bears is the most variable of modern bears. The typical size depends upon which population it is from, and most accepted races vary widely in size.",
        "The normal range of physical dimensions for a brown bear is a head-and-body length of 1.4 to 2.8 m (4 ft 7 in to 9 ft 2 in) and a shoulder height of 70 to 153 cm (2 ft 4 in to 5 ft 0 in).",
        "Brown bears are often not fully brown. Brown bears have long, thick fur, with a moderately long mane at the back of the neck which varies somewhat across the races. In India, brown bears can be reddish with silver tips, while in China, brown bears are bicolored with a yellow-brown or whitish cape across the neck, chest, and shoulders. North American grizzlies can be dark brown (almost black) to cream (almost white) or yellowish brown and often have darker colored legs.",
        "One thing all brown bears around the world have in common is a hump of muscle on their back between the shoulders. Combined with huge paws and long front claws, the muscles make these animals powerful diggers.",
        "Brown bears have very large and curved claws, those present on the forelimbs being longer than those on the hind limbs. They may reach 5 to 6 centimeters (2.0 to 2.4 in) and may measure 7 to 10 centimeters (2.8 to 3.9 in) along the curve. The rear feet of adult bears have been found to typically measure 21 to 36 cm (8.3 to 14.2 in) long, while the forefeet tend to measure about 40% less in length.",
        "Due to their claw structure, in addition to their excessive weight, adult brown bears cannot typically climb trees as can both species of black bear, although in rare cases adult female brown bears have been seen in trees.",
        "Despite their enormous size, brown bears are extremely fast, having been clocked at speeds of 50 kilometers (30 miles) per hour.",
        "The home range of a brown bear is extremely large, reaching up to 2 thousands square kilometers (770 square miles) in males, however they are not highly territorial.",
        "The brown bear is often described as nocturnal. However, it frequently seems to peak in activity in the morning and early evening hours. Studies have shown that activity throughout the range can occur at nearly any time of night or day, with bears who dwell in areas with more extensive human contact being more likely to be fully nocturnal.",
        "Brown bears tend to be solitary animals, except for females and their cubs; although they may gather in large numbers at major food sources (e.g., moth colonies, open garbage dumps or rivers holding spawning salmon). In these cases, a dominance hierarchy involving aggression is established. While it is large adult males that are the highest-ranking, the most aggressive individuals are females that have young.",
        "Brown bears are omnivorous. Most brown bears are not highly carnivorous, as they derive up to 90% of their dietary food energy from vegetable matter. Their diet varies with the season \u2013 from grass and shoots in the spring to berries and apples in the summer, nuts and plums in autumn. All year round they eat roots, insects, mammals, fish, reptiles, and of course, honey.",
        "In the Kamchatka peninsula and several parts of coastal Alaska, including Kodiak Island, brown bears feed largely on spawning salmon, whose nutrition and abundance explain the enormous size of the bears in these areas.",
        "In fall a brown bear may eat as much as 40 kilograms (90 pounds) of food each day, and it may weigh twice as much before hibernation as it will in spring.",
        "Brown bears hibernate throughout winter, preserving energy by reducing heart rate and body temperature by a few degrees. Hibernation takes place in a den, often dug into a sheltered slope, in which the bear may survive for over half a year without eating, drinking, urinating or defecating",
        "Brown bears mate from May to July, and a gestation of 180 to 266 days follows, with births occurring from January to March, usually while the female is still in hibernation. She generally lays down two to three offspring, and breeds again 2 to 4 years later.",
        "While the brown bear's range has shrunk and it has faced local extinctions, it remains listed as a least concern species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).",

        "Bull sharks have the strongest bite of any shark species, scientists have discovered. Relative to their body size, bull sharks bite harder than other, larger predatory sharks. Adult bull sharks can bite with a maximum force equivalent to 6 thousandsN, a study of their jaws and jaw muscles has shown.",
        "Sharks must keep salt in their bodies to survive, and most can live only in salt water. But bull sharks have developed special adaptations\u2014the way their kidneys function and special glands near their tails\u2014that help them keep salt in their bodies even when they're in freshwater.",
        "Bull sharks often hunt in murky water, and their vision is poor compared to other sharks. The biggest advantage of hunting in murky water is they can get very close to their prey without being detected.",
        "Bull sharks have been known to use the bump-and-bite technique to attack their prey. After the first initial contact, they continue to bite and tackle prey until they are unable to flee.",
        "Bull sharks are usually solitary hunters, but sometimes they do hunt in pairs. They can cruise through shallow waters with quick acceleration and high aggression toward other animals and humans. They are known for its unpredictable, often agile and aggressive behavior.",
        "Bull sharks primarily eat bony fish and other sharks, including juvenile members of their own species. Less commonly, they also eat sea turtles, crustaceans, squid, dolphins, sea birds, and swimming land mammals. There have been reports in Australia of river-dwelling bulls eating horses, and in Mozambique, they feed on hippos.",
        "Many experts consider bull sharks to be more dangerous to humans than any other species of shark; along with the tiger shark and great white shark, are among the three shark species most likely to bite humans.",
        "Bull sharks usually mate during late summer and early autumn in the water of river mouths. They are viviparous marine animals which born baby sharks, or pups, in much the same way as human beings and other mammals. After gestating for 12 months, a bull shark may give birth to 1 to 13 live young. They are born fully developed, about 70 cm (27.6 in) long and ready to look after itself.",

        "All members of a bumblebee colony undergo complete metamorphosis, passing through the egg, larval and pupal stages before becoming adults.",
        "Nest size depends on species of bumblebee. Most form colonies of between 50 and 400 individuals, but colonies have been documented as small as 20 individuals and as large as 1700. These nests are small compared to honey bee hives, which hold about 50 thousands bees.",
        "Nest sites vary between bumblebee species. Many species nest underground, choosing old rodent burrows or sheltered places, and avoiding places that receive direct sunlight that could result in overheating. Other species make nests above ground, whether in thick grass or in holes in trees.",
        "A bumblebee nest is not organised into hexagonal combs like that of a honey bee; the cells are instead clustered together untidily.",
        "Bumblebees eat nectar and pollen, both of which are found in flowers. Pollen is eaten mainly by the queen and the larvae as it is full of protein, although the workers eat some too. Nectar is mainly water with different types of sugary substances in it. Honey is just nectar that has less water and so the sugar has become more concentrated.",

        "Capybaras are very social animals. They live in groups of around 10-20 adults of both sexes, although groups can range in size from 3 to 100; larger aggregations often form around water resources during the dry season. Each group maintains and defends a territory that encompasses feeding and wallowing sites. Among males, there is a strict dominance hierarchy enforced by chasing and, rarely, fights.",
        "Capybaras can make dog-like barks when threatened or when females are herding young.",
        "Mating season is year round with peak at beginning of wet season. Capybaras mate only in water, and if a female does not want to mate with a certain male, she either submerges or leaves the water. Dominant males are highly protective of the females, but they usually cannot prevent some of the subordinates from copulating. The larger the group, the harder it is for the male to watch all the females.",
        "Capybara gestation is 130\u2013150 days, and produces a litter of 4 capybara young on average, but may produce between 1 and 8 in a single litter. Birth is on land and the female rejoins the group within a few hours of delivering the newborn capybaras, which join the group as soon as they are mobile. Pups are weaned at about 3 months old, during which time they suckle both from their own mother and the other females in the group, who are usually closely related. Around a year old, pups leave their parent's groups to find new ones.",

        "Chameleons are solitary and extremely territorial, rejecting even the company of other chameleons.",
        "Most lizards have five toes, but the chameleon's five toes are modified into groups: on the forefoot, the two outside toes are joined to form one group, and the three inside toes form another; the hind foot has the opposite arrangement. This allows them to grasp branches just like our thumbs and fingers can grasp objects.",
        "Chameleons also use their long tail when moving in the trees to grab a branch and secure their position.The chameleon's tail cannot be broken off and regrown like those of many other lizards.",
        "Chameleons have the most distinctive eyes of any reptile. The upper and lower eyelids are joined, with only a pinhole large enough for the pupil to see through. Each eye can pivot and focus independently, allowing the chameleon to observe two different objects simultaneously. This gives them a full 360-degree arc of vision around their bodies.",
        "Chameleon skin has a superficial layer which contains pigments, and under the layer are cells with guanine crystals.Chameleons change color by changing the space between the guanine crystals, which changes the wavelength of light reflected off the crystals which changes the color of the skin.",
        "Color change in chameleons has functions in social signaling and in reactions to temperature and other conditions, as well as in camouflage.",
        "Chameleons are largely carnivorous, eating a varied diet of insects, although some larger chameleons will eat birds and lizards. Chameleons enjoy insects like crickets, grasshoppers, locusts and stick bugs. Some chameleons, specifically the veiled chameleon, also eats a small amount of plants and flowers.",
        "Chameleons don't move around very fast, so they depends upon its long, sticky tongue to catch prey. When a chameleon spots an insect, it quickly snaps out its tongue. When its tongue hits the insect it creates suction that allows the chameleon to pull the insect into its mouth.",
        "Chameleon's tongue is propelled by incredible speed: it takes 0.07 seconds for tongue to reach the victim.Their tongue can be 1.5 to 2 times longer than their body (excluding tail).",
        "Most female chameleons lay eggs but some species such as the Jackson's chameleon have a five to seven month gestation period.",
        "Snakes and birds are the most common predators of the chameleon, along with some mammals.",
        "Today many chameleon species are considered to be threatened with extinction, and other chameleon species are even considered to to endangered.",
        "The egg of the rare Parson's chameleon is believed to take up to two years to hatch.",
        "Chameleons seem to prefer running water to still water.",

        "Chamois announce danger with a whistling sound and foot stamping. When alarmed, these animals flee to the most innaccessible places, often making prodigous leaps.",
        "During the summer months the diet consists chiefly of herbs and flowers, but in winter the chamois eats lichens, mosses, and young pine shoots. It has been known to fast for two weeks and survive when the snow is so deep that food can not be found.",
        "Chamois population in Europe is about 400 thousands.",
        "In the 20th century chamois were introduced into New Zealand, where their numbers quickly increased up to almost 100 thousands by the 1970s and where they threatened the local vegetation. The chamois population has since decreased by about 20 thousands.",
        "Lynx and wolves are the main predator of the chamois.",

        "Female cheetahs select a lair, either a rocky outcrop or marshy area with tall grass, before giving birth to their cubs. Mothers only leave the cubs to hunt, before returning to nurse the young. Males do not help with the rearing of young.",
        "Cheetahs are caring, affectionate and dedicated mothers. They spend a long time caring for their cubs and teaching them essential survival skills like hunting. Cubs typically stay with their mothers for one and a half to two years.",
        "Cheetah moms may use their tails, tipped in black or white fur, to signal to their cubs while traveling through tall grass.",
        "Cheetah moms chirp like birds to call their cubs when they're out of sight. Likewise, cheetah cubs chirp when they are looking for their mom.",

        "Originally raised for cockfighting or for special ceremonies, chickens were not kept for food until the Hellenistic period (4th\u20132nd centuries BC).",
        "The domesticated bird spread west-ward from India to Greece, and was later introduced to Western Europe by invading Roman armies. By the Roman era, chickens were used as food, both for their meat and for their eggs. Romans commonly carried them on their ships, as a convenient source of fresh food.",
        "Chickens were spread by Polynesian seafarers and reached Easter Island in the 12th century AD, where they were the only domestic animal, with the possible exception of the Polynesian rat (Rattus exulans).",
        "While it was long assumed that chickens had been brought to the Americas by the Spanish conquistadors, presumably pre-Columbian chickens have been identified at several sites throughout the Americas, most notably at the site of El Arenal-1 in Chile, ca 1350 CE.",
        "Since the wild progenitor of chickens is still living, several studies have been able to examine the behaviors of wild and domestic animals. Domesticated chickens are less active, have fewer social interactions with other chickens, are less aggressive to would-be predators, are less susceptible to stress, and are less likely to go looking for foreign food sources than their wild counterparts. Domestic chickens have increased adult body weight and simplified plumage \u2013 domestic chicken egg production starts earlier, is more frequent, and produces larger eggs.",
        "Chickens are gregarious birds and live together in flocks. They have a communal approach to the incubation of eggs and raising of young.",
        "Chickens are omnivores. In the wild, they often scratch at the soil to search for seeds, insects and even animals as large as lizards, small snakes, or young mice.",
        "The average chicken may live for 5 to 10 years, depending on the breed. The world's oldest known chicken was a hen which died of heart failure at the age of 16 years according to the Guinness World Records.",
        "There are more chickens in the world than any other bird.",
        "More than 50 billion chickens are reared annually as a source of meat and eggs. In the United States alone, more than 8 billion chickens are slaughtered each year for meat, and more than 300 million chickens are reared for egg production.",

Deer heads have flat-topped heads, more widely set eyes, larger ears, and longer, more slender legs. Deer heads were the breed standard conformation in the mid-20th century, but current breed standards defined by registries such as the AKC specify the apple-head conformation.",
        "The Chihuahua has a moderate to high energy level and may develop behavioral problems if not given enough activity. Exercise and mental stimulation will help maintain your dog's mental and physical health. Be aware when you are walking a Chihuahua, as they are known to be aggressive toward larger dogs if not properly trained. You may need to be on alert to remove your dog from potential conflict.",

        "Drawings of Chihuahua-like dogs decorate the artifacts of lost civilizations around the world.",
        "Trading among ancient cultures was more widespread than commonly assumed, so it is no surprise that similar dog types took root in far-flung places. How the Chihuahua type first came to the peoples of Mexico, however, is a secret of prehistory. We do know that when the Toltecs held sway in Mexico about a thousand years ago, their breed of choice was the Techichi, a larger, heavier ancestor of today's Chi.",

        "Cichlids can be herbivorous, feeding on algae and plants; carnivorous, preying on small animals, other fishes, and insect larvae; or detritivores, eating all types of organic material. The species are very specific in habitat choice: some live only among the rocks, others in open water, others along sandy beaches. They have evolved behaviors and tooth structures to live this way.",
        "Cichlids are able to communicate by various means: visual, acoustic, chemical and tactile.",
        "Cichlids mate either monogamously or polygamously. The mating system of a given cichlid species is not consistently associated with its brooding system.",
        "All cichlids have some form of parental care for their eggs and fry. That parental care may come in the form of guarding the eggs and fry or it may come in the form of mouthbrooding. Mouthbrooding is the care given by some groups of animals to their offspring by holding them in the mouth of the parent for extended periods of time.",

        "Like all parrots, cockatoos are zygodactyl (having two toes pointing forward and two backward). This, along with the use of their beak, gives them the ability to use their feet much like we use our hands and helps make them terrific climbers! Having the ability to climb is a necessity for birds that live and nest in thick forests.",

        "The most consumed species of crab in the world is the Japanese Blue Crab.",
        "The crabs can grow back their claws after losing it. So, in some species, for human consumption their claws are manually squeezed and pulled off returning the live crab in water.",
        "Crabs are often boiled alive. In 2005, Norwegian scientists concluded that crustaceans could not feel pain. However, a study by Bob Elwood and Mirjam Appel of Queens University in Belfast, found that hermit crabs reacted to electric shocks. This may indicate that some crustaceans are able to feel and remember pain.",

Alligators tend to have wide, U-shaped, rounded snouts, while crocodiles tend to have longer, more pointed, V-shaped snouts.The fourth tooth on the lower jaw sticks up over the upper lip on crocodiles, so you can see it when their mouth is closed. In alligators, this fourth tooth is covered up.",
        "The term \"Crocodile tears\" refers to a false, insincere display of emotion, such as a hypocrite crying fake tears of grief. In fact, crocodiles can and do generate tears, but they do not actually cry. Tears are normally only noticeable if the crocodile has been out of the water for a long time and the eyes begin to dry out."

Cuttlefish change color and pattern, and the shape or texture of the skin to communicate to other cuttlefish, to camouflage themselves, and as a deimatic display to warn off potential predators.",
        "While the cuttlefish uses its mantle cavity for jet-propulsion when quick movement is needed, it relies on its specialized fins for basic mobility and maintaining consistent speeds. Resembling a short, flouncy skirt, the muscular fin can maneuver the cuttlefish in nearly any direction: backward, forward, even in circles, with such movement being more energetically efficient than jetting.",
        "Within their bodies, cuttlefish have a long, oval bone called a cuttlebone. This bone is used to regulate buoyancy using chambers that may be filled with gas and/or water depending on where the cuttlefish is in the water column. The cuttlebone is rich in calcium and is often sold in pet stores as a nutritional supplement for birds. [Photos below: top and bottom view of a cuttlebone]",
        "Although color-blind, the cuttlefish has two of the most highly developed eyes in the animal kingdom. It can see well in low light and can also detect polarized light, enhancing its perception of contrast. The eyes of cuttlefish have a modified horizontal slit-pupil with a distinctive W-shape in bright light, while in darkness the pupil is circular.",

        "In appearance, the dhole has been variously described as combining the physical characteristics of the grey wolf and red fox, and as being \"cat-like\" on account of its long backbone and slender limbs.",
        "The dhole is a highly social animal, living in large clans without rigid dominance hierarchies and containing multiple breeding females. Such clans usually consist of 12 individuals, but groups of over 40 are known.",
        "Dholes are great communicators and use an eerie whistle to communicate with each other. They also use a variety of other noises, including clucks and high-pitched screams that are not found anywhere else in the canid families. The whistling sound the dhole is known for is so distinct, it can be used to identify individual animals.",
        "Dholes are incredibly athletic. They are fast runners, excellent swimmers, and impressive jumpers.",
        "A dhole can jump over 2.1 meters (7 feet) straight up into the air.",
        "Dholes prey on hoofed mammals \u2014 in India, they eat deer, wild pigs, buffalo, and wild goats. In Southeast Asia, dholes feed on deer, gaur, and banteng, and in Siberia, they eat deer, wild sheep, and reindeer. Dholes also eat berries, bugs, lizards, and rabbits and can hunt well on their own if needed.",
        "When hunting as a pack, dholes can catch prey over 10 times their own body weight and can even fend off a tiger.",
        "The dhole is listed as Endangered by the IUCN as populations are decreasing and are estimated at fewer than 2 thousands adults. Factors contributing to this decline include habitat loss, loss of prey, competition with other species, persecution due to livestock predation and disease transfer from domestic dogs.",
        "During the Pleistocene, the dhole ranged throughout Asia, Europe and North America but became restricted to its historical range 12 thousands to 18 thousands years ago.",
        "In 2016, the Korean company Sooam Biotech was reported to be attempting to clone the dhole using dogs as surrogate mothers to help conserve the species.",
        "Three dhole-like animals are featured on the coping stone of the Bharhut stupa dating from 100 BC. They are shown waiting by a tree, with a woman or spirit trapped up it, a scene reminiscent of dholes treeing tigers."

        "The dingo is a type of feral dog native to Australia.",
        "The name dingo is also used to describe wild dogs of Malaysia, Thailand, the Philippines, and New Guinea.",
        "The oldest known dingo fossil in Australia dates from about 3 thousands years ago, studies of the diversity of DNA in the mitochondria of living individuals have suggested that the first dingoes were introduced to Australia sometime between 4 thousands and 18 thousands years ago. (By contrast, humans arrived in Australia at least 30 thousands years ago).",
        "The name \"dingo\" comes from the Dharug language used by the Indigenous Australians of the Sydney area.",
        "The first British colonists to arrive in Australia in 1788 established a settlement at Port Jackson and noted \"dingoes\" living with indigenous Australians.",
        "The lifespan of a dingo is up to 10 years in the wild, but can reach 15 to 20 years in captivity.",
        "The dingo possesses a lean, hardy body designed for speed, agility and stamina.",
        "Similar to the domestic dog in structure and habits, the dingo has short, soft fur, a bushy tail, and erect, pointed ears.",
        "Australian adult males of dingo are generally larger than females, weigh between 15.5 and 19.5 kg, and have an average body length of 125 centimeters (49 inches). Females weigh between 14 and 16 kg and average 122 centimeters (48 inches) in body length. Shoulder heights range from 53 (21 inches) to 59 centimeters (23 inches).",
        "Southeast Asian dingoes are smaller than dingoes found in Australia.",
        "The dingo's three main coat colors are described as being either light ginger, black and tan, or creamy white. The ginger color ranges from a deep rust to a pale cream and can be found in 74% of dingoes. There is often small white markings on the tip of the tail, the feet, and the chest but there are no large white patches.",
        "Dingoes tend to be nocturnal in warmer regions, but less so in cooler areas. Their main period of activity is around dusk and dawn. The periods of activity are short (often less than one hour) with short times of resting.",
        "Dingoes are the largest land predator in Australia.",
        "The diet of Australian dingoes is comprised of 72% mammalian prey, with birds and reptiles comprising theremainder. On occasion dingoes may eat kangaroos, wallabies, sheep, and calves, but the majority of their dietis composed of small animals, especially the introduced European rabbit.",
        "A dingo can run at speeds up to 48 km/h (30 mph)",
        "Although dingoes are often seen alone, many of these individuals belong to a socially integrated pack of up to 12 animals. These packs generally comprise of an extended family, which includes a mating pair, the offspring of the year and sometimes offspring of previous years. Dingoes display a dominance hierarchy between and within both males and females. Dominant pairs are usually the only successful breeders, however the other pack members often assist with the rearing of the pups.",
        "Dingoes breed once annually; after a gestation period of 63 days, females give birth to 4\u20135 pups (occasionally up to 10).",
        "Like all domestic dogs, dingoes tend towards phonetic communication. However, in contrast to domestic dogs, dingoes howl and whimper more, and bark less. Eight sound classes with 19 sound types have been identified.",
        "Dingoes are primarily killed by humans, crocodiles, and sometimes by other canid species, such as jackals and domestic dogs. Dingoes are also killed by dingoes from other packs.",
        "The dingo's social behavior is about as flexible as that of a coyote or gray wolf, which is perhaps one of the reasons it was initially believed that the dingo was descended from the Indian wolf.",
        "Although dingoes are large enough to be dangerous, they generally avoid conflict with humans. Apart from the well-known case in which an infant was taken from a campsite, there have been numerous confirmed dingo attacks, often involving people feeding wild dingoes.",
        "Until 2004, the dingo was categorized as of \"least concern\" on the Red List of Threatened Species. However, it has since been recategorised as \"vulnerable,\" following the decline in numbers to around 30% of \"pure\" dingoes, due to crossbreeding with domestic dogs.",
        "In the 1920s, the Dingo Fence was erected on the basis of the Wild Dog Act (1921) and, until 1931, thousands of miles of Dingo Fences had been erected in several areas of South Australia. It is generally considered the longest fence in the world."

        "First raised in the 9th century, the Doge's Palace was rebuilt many times thereafter, and it was with the construction of the Sala del Maggior Consiglio in 1340 that the present building really took shape. Work continued until 1420, largely under the guidance of architect and sculptor Filippo Calendario.",
        "There were numerous expansions of the Doge's Palace throughout subsequent centuries, including after 1574 and 1577, when fires ravaged parts of the building. Great Venetian architects, such as Filippo Calendario and Antonio Rizzo, as well as the masters of Venetian painting \u2013 Tintoretto, Titian, and Veronese \u2013 contributed to the elaborate interior design.",
        "Since 1996, the Doge's Palace has been part of the Venetian museums network, which has been under the management of the Fondazione Musei Civici di Venezia since 2008.",
        "The Porta della Carta, the palace's main entrance, is the link between the Doge's Palace and St. Mark's Basilica, created by the brothers Giovanni and Bartolomeo Bon in the mid-1400s.",
        "The north side of the courtyard is closed by the junction between the palace and St. Mark's Basilica, which used to be the Doge's chapel. At the center of the courtyard stand two well-heads dating from the mid-16th century.",
        "After entering the inner courtyard you'll find a flight of stairs that led to the Doge's private quarters, known as the \"Scala dei Giganti\" and flanked by huge statues of Mars and Neptune.",
        "Inside, the walls are made of stucco and the ceilings feature ornate works of art. The doge's apartment was on the second floor while the chancellery offices were located on the first. On the third level was the Sala del Collegio, where the doge met with foreign ambassadors. Here, today's visitors will find portraits of all of Venice's doges, except one, who disgraced himself by attempting a coup d'etat.",
        "Restructured in the 14th century, the Chamber of the Great Council was decorated with a fresco by Guariento and later with works by the most famous artists of the period, including Gentile da Fabriano, Pisanello, Alvise Vivarini, Vittore Carpaccio, Giovanni Bellini, Pordenone and Titian. 53 meters long and 25 meters wide, this is not only the largest chamber in the Doge's Palace, but also one of the largest rooms in Europe.",

        "There are 43 different species of dolphins that have been recognized. 38 of them are marine dolphins which are those that we are the most aware of and 5 of them are river dolphins.",
        "Hector's dolphin is the smallest of the dolphins. Mature adults have a total length from 1.2 to 1.6 meters (3-ft-11-in to 5-ft-3-in) and weigh from 40 to 60 kilograms (88 to 132 pounds).",
        "Dolphins are highly social animals, often living in pods of up to a dozen individuals, though pod sizes and structures vary greatly between species and locations. In places with a high abundance of food, pods can merge temporarily, forming a superpod; such groupings may exceed 1 thousands dolphins.",
        "The single blowhole on top of their head has a flap that opens to reveal a pair of nostrils, which dolphins use for breathing when they surface.",
        "Dolphins have to be conscious to breath. This means that they cannot go into a full deep sleep, because then they would suffocate. Dolphins have \"solved\" that by letting one half of their brain sleep at a time. This has been determined by doing EEG studies on dolphins.",
        "Dolphins have an eye on each side of their head. Each eye moves independently of the other, so dolphins can see ahead, to the side, and behind them. They can also see very well both underwater and above water. Their vision out of the water is about as good as a cat's or a dog's vision.",
        "Their ear holes are tiny, about the size of a crayon point, but dolphins probably have the best hearing in the Animal Kingdom. They receive sounds through their jawbone and head, and the vibrations pass into the tiny bones of their inner ear.",
        "All dolphins make sounds that travel underwater, bounce off something, and then return to the dolphins as echoes. This sophisticated echolocation allows dolphins to find food or avoid predators, even in dark or murky water.",
        "While some dolphins eat fish like herring, cod or mackerel, some others eat squids. Even more, large dolphins like the killer whales, eat some other marine mammals like seals or sea lions and sometime even turtles.",
        "On average an adult dolphin will eat 4 to 9% of its body weight in fish, so a 250 kilograms (550 pounds) dolphin will eat 10 to 22.5 kilograms (22 to 50 pounds) fish per day.",
        "Dolphins also work together to help when one animal is sick, hurt, or giving birth. They take turns pushing the hurt or young dolphin to the surface so it can breathe. Pods of dolphins will attack an intruder as a group and can even kill a large shark by ramming it as a group!",
        "Many types of animals have strict annual breeding seasons, but that isn't so for dolphins. While they often can reproduce at any time, dolphins in certain geographic locations partake in heightened mating activities during both the spring and autumn seasons.",
        "For dolphins the average gestation period can vary significantly depending on the species from 9 months all the way up to 17 months.",
        "Dolphins give birth to live calves while staying in relatively shallow waters.",
        "With twins being a very rare occurrence, dolphins usually give birth to one calf. As soon as the calf is brought into the world, the mother must quickly take it to the surface for its first breath and will nurse the calf with her own milk for at least 12 months.",
        "Most dolphin calves will stay with their mothers for 3 to 6 years.",
        "For most of the smaller species of dolphins, only a few of the larger sharks, such as the bull shark, dusky shark, tiger shark and great white shark, are a potential risk, especially for calves. Some cases of killer whales eating dolphins have been documented, but is not a common behavior.",
        "Although some dolphin species are considered an endangered species, alarming statistics suggest that more and more dolphins are being killed by illegal dynamite fishing, being caught in fishing nets, collisions with boats and or propellers, marine pollution, disease and beaching due to sonar interference than ever before.",
        "Dolphins are, in fact, not monogamous.",
        "Dolphins have several highly developed forms of communication. They have a \"signature whistle\" which allows other individuals to recognise them.",
        "Dolphins are able to hear a broader range of frequencies than humans. While we can hear sounds from 20 Hz to 20 Khz, dolphins are able to hear from 20 to 150 Khz being up to 7 times more sensitive than human ear.",
        "Some dolphins can jump as high as 9 meters (30 feet) above the water's surface.",

        "Donkeys today come in all colors and coat texture. The most common coat colour is grey, followed by brown and then black, roan and broken coloured donkeys (a combination of brown and white or black and white markings) and the rarest colour is pure white.",
        "Although slower than horses, donkeys are surefooted and can carry heavy loads over rough terrain.",
        "Donkeys have a notorious reputation for stubbornness, but this has been attributed to a much stronger sense of self-preservation than exhibited by horses.",
        "Although formal studies of their behaviour and cognition are rather limited, donkeys appear to be quite intelligent, cautious, friendly, playful, and eager to learn.",
        "The most appropriate feed for donkeys is straw, hay and grass in moderation. Although you may not think it, horse and donkey dietary requirements are very different. Donkeys love to graze all day but will eat everything in sight if they can, so if you're looking after donkeys, it's important to feed them a healthy diet.",
        "On tropical islands where plants evolved in the absence of large mammalian herbivores, feral donkeys pose a real threat of extinction for native plants. Efforts to remove donkeys from habitats where they are not native has generated a great deal of controversy, pitting animal rights groups against biologists and other conservation groups who see donkeys as an alien species and a threat to biodiversity conservation.",

        "It's a fact that a wild duck can live 20 years or more. The world record is a Mallard Drake that lived to a ripe old age of 27 years. Domestic ducks typically live 10-15 years or less in captivity.",
        "While dimorphic (a difference in coloration between genders) plumages are common for many types of birds, ducks take this to a new art with outrageous, even garish patterns on males with gaudy colors and vibrant patterns. Females are much more subdued with neutral colors and mottled patterns for camouflage from their enemies when they are in their nests.",
        "Ducks have webbed feet which allows them to paddle and swim in the water more smoothly.",
        "Ducks feet has no nerves or blood vessels, meaning that their feet do not feel the cold! This enables ducks to swim in icy water, and walk in ice and snow.",
        "Ducks have three eyelids. The top and bottom as well as a third that is found on the side of the eye. It is clear and acts much like goggles.",
        "All ducks have highly waterproof feathers as a result of an intricate feather structure and a waxy coating that is spread on each feather while preening. A duck's feathers are so waterproof that even when the duck dives underwater, its downy underlayer of feathers will stay completely dry.",
        "Ducks keep their feathers clean by preening. They do this by putting their heads in funny positions and putting their beaks into their body. They preen themselves very often.",
        "Ducks are very social animals who feel most at ease when they're in larger groups of other ducks, who are called paddlings. They spend their days looking for food in the grass or in water, and they sleep together with their paddlings at night.",

They feed on small fish and fish eggs, small crustaceans, frogs, salamanders and other amphibians, snails, worms and mollusks, aquatic and land insects, algae and aquatic plants and roots, grass and weeds, seeds and grain, small berries, fruits and nuts. In addition to these nutritious foods, some ducks will also eat sand, gravel, pebbles and small shells to provide grit that aids their digestion. Grit may also provide trace amounts of critical minerals as part of an overall healthy, varied diet.",
        "Ducks are often classified by the way they feed, either as dabbling ducks or diving ducks. Dabbling ducks feed on the surface of water or on land, or as deep as they can reach by up-ending without completely submerging. Diving ducks forage deep underwater. To be able to submerge more easily, the diving ducks are heavier than dabbling ducks, and therefore have more difficulty taking off to fly.",

        "As with whales and dolphins, the dugong has a tapered body that ends in a deeply notched tail, or fluke. The forelimbs are rounded flippers lacking nails; there are no hind limbs or any discernible neck. The snout is broad and bristled. The thick bristles (vibrissae) function as sensory hairs and are important for detecting, discriminating, and manipulating food.",
        "Unlike other marine mammals, dugongs cannot hold their breath under water for very long. They stay submerged from 30 seconds to over six minutes, depending on their activity, and dives typically last 1-3 minutes.",
        "Although they are social animals, they are usually solitary or found in pairs due to the inability of seagrass beds to support large populations. Gatherings of hundreds of dugongs sometimes happen, but they last only for a short time.",
        "Communication is vital among individuals in this species. The two primary methods of communication this species uses are sound and vision. Much like dolphins, dugongs use chirps, whistles, barks and other sounds that echo underwater in order to communicate.",
        "The dugong is the only strictly herbivorous marine mammal. Dugongs graze on sea grasses and aquatic plants. They need to eat large amounts of their food.",
        "As in most herbivores, the dugong's brain is very small compared to its body size, likely because it does not have to develop complex hunting strategies to capture prey.",
        "Despite the longevity of the dugong, which may live for 70 years or more, females give birth only a few times during their life, and invest considerable parental care in their young. One young is born after a gestation period of 12 to 14 months and will continue to suckle from the mother for about 18 months. They may remain with the female for a number of years. A calf will only leave its mother once it has matured.",
        "Dugongs have very few natural predators. Their massive size, tough skin, dense bone structure, and rapidly clotting blood may aid defenses. Sharks, crocodiles, and killer whales, however, feed on juvenile dugongs.",
        "The dugong has been hunted for thousands of years for its meat and oil. Traditional hunting still has great cultural significance in several countries in its modern range, particularly northern Australia and the Pacific Islands. The dugong's current distribution is fragmented, and many populations are believed to be close to extinction.",

        "Philippine eagle (Pithecophaga jefferyi) [photo below] is considered the largest species of eagles in the world in terms of length and wing surface, with the Steller's sea eagle and the harpy eagle being larger in terms of weight and bulk.",
        "The female of all known species of eagles is larger than the male",
        "Eagles are diurnal, meaning they are most active during the day and sleep at night.",

        "Like all raptors, eagles kill their prey with their talons.",
        "The eagle eye is among the strongest in the animal kingdom, with an eyesight estimated at 4 to 8 times stronger than that of the average human. An eagle is said to be able to spot a rabbit 3.2 kilometers (2 miles) away. Although an eagle may only weigh 4.5 kg (10 pounds), its eyes are roughly the same size as those of a human.",
        "Their eyes don't move much in the eye socket, but an eagle can rotate its head about 270 degrees, just like an owl can, to look around. Eagles also have a clear eyelid that protects their precious eyes from dust and dirt.",
        "Some eagles are built with short wings and long tails enabling them to hunt in the tight confines of a forest, while others have short tails and broad long wings allowing them to soar high above open plains and water.",
        "Some eagles can fly hundreds of kilometers while foraging for their food.",
        "Eagles are carnivores, which means that they feed only on meat. They mostly hunt their prey, though some species actively hunt more than others. Prey includes fish, rabbits, marmots, hares, ground squirrels, mice, and sometimes slow-flying birds, reptiles, martens, foxes, and even deer. Some species of eagles are scavengers, which means that they primarily eat fish and animals that are already dead.",
        "Eagles do not need to eat every day. They have a special digestive organ known as the crop, which stores food until there is room for it in the stomach. This allows them to store a large meal until it is later needed, and prevents the eagle from growing weak if food is scarce for several days or weeks.",
        "Eagles are monogamous. They mate for life and use the same nest each year.",
        "Eagles normally build their nests, called eyries, in tall trees or on high cliffs. Male and female eagles build the nest together. Both eagles will bring sticks to add to the nest structure and arrange them within the nest. The nest building activity is part of their pair bonding.",
        "Eagles are often informally divided into four groups: Sea eagles or fish eagles take fish as a large part of their diets, either fresh or as carrion; Booted eagles so-called because feathers grow down the legs and cover the toes; Snake or serpent eagles are, as the name suggests, adapted to hunting reptiles; Harpy eagles or \"giant forest eagles\" are large eagles that inhabit tropical forests.",
        "Golden eagles can reach maximum air speed of 320 kilometers (200 miles) per hour!",
        "The bald eagle is noted for having flown with the heaviest load verified to be carried by any flying bird, since one eagle flew with a 6.8 kilograms (15 pounds) mule deer fawn.",

        "The eagle represents spiritual protection, carries prayers, and brings strength, courage, wisdom, illumination of spirit, healing, creation, and a knowledge of magic.",
        "Native Americans historically gave eagle feathers to non-indigenous people and also members of other tribes who were deemed worthy.",
        "The modern word eagle was derived from Latin: aquila by way of French: aigle. The origin of aquila is unknown, but it is believed to possibly derive from either aquilus (meaning dark-colored, swarthy, or blackish) as a reference to the plumage of eagles or from aquilo (meaning north wind)."

        "The eyes don't help the echidna see well, but its acute sense of hearing and smell give this unusual mammal the information it needs to know to survive.",
        "The echidna's snout is very sensitive to touch and can feel vibrations.",
        "At 33 \u00b0C (91.4 \u00b0F), the echidna possess the second lowest active body temperature of all mammals, behind the platypus.",
        "Echidnas are largely solitary creatures and only convene to mate. Mating season spans from July to August.",
        "The female lays a single soft-shelled, leathery egg 22 days after mating, and deposits it directly into her pouch. Hatching takes place after 10 days of gestation; the young echidna, called a puggle, born larval and fetus-like, then sucks milk and remains in the pouch for 45 to 55 days,at which time it starts to develop spines. The mother digs a nursery burrow and deposits the young, returning every five days to suckle it until it is weaned at seven months. Puggles will stay within their mother's den for up to a year before leaving.",
        "Other than fires and drought, the main threats to the slow-moving echidna are feral dogs and cats as well as dingoes and foxes.",
        "The echidnas are named after Echidna, a creature from Greek mythology who was half-woman, half-snake, as the animal was perceived to have qualities of both mammals and reptiles.",

        " Emperor penguins primarily communicate vocally, but they also communicate through body language and posturing. They all look virtually identical, which makes individual recognition very difficult. To overcome this, emperor penguins have evolved different sounding voices and the ability to recognize the individual voices of their mates or chicks. This allows the birds to recognize and find their important conspecifics amid the masses, which all look the same.",
        "Emperor penguins breed in the winter. After a courtship of several weeks, a female emperor penguin lays one single egg then leaves! Each penguin egg's father balances it on his feet and covers it with his brood pouch, a very warm layer of feathered skin designed to keep the egg cozy. There the males stand, for about 65 days, through icy temperatures, cruel winds, and blinding storms; during this time they will lose about 40% of their body weight.",
        "Although emperor penguins are effective hunters, they are also prey to a few Antarctic animals as well. Only a third of the juvenile penguins will make it to their first birthday, falling prey to seabirds like giant petrels or skuas. In the water, both juveniles and adults are eaten by leopard seals and killer whales.",

These calls are usually made during courtship and the breeding season, heard up to 2 kilometers (21.2 miles) away! A hiss, described by one of our animal trainers as bloodcurdling, is effective at warning off dingoes.",
        "Emus form breeding pairs during the summer months of December and January, and may remain together for about five months.",
        "The emu is able to store fat very efficiently. This allows it to go for a very long time without food and permits the male to incubate the eggs over a 48 to 56 day incubation period. During that time, he neither eats nor drinks and loses up to one-third of his body weight.",
        "Newly hatched chicks are cream-colored with dark brown stripes. They are cared for by the male for a further four to six months. Emus are full-grown at 12 to 14 months but don't reach sexual maturity until about 2 years of age.",

        "That very-long tail helps the fossa balance and jump from branch to branch.",
        "The elusive fossa is a solitary animal and spends its time both in the trees and on the ground.",
        "Until recently, it was believed that fossas were nocturnal because they were so hard to find in the wild. Recent studies show that fossas nap and hunt day or night, depending on mood or circumstance.",
        "A fossa can travel up to 25 kilometers (15.5 miles) in a day.",
        "Lemurs are its main food source for fossa but they also eat: fish, lizards, birds, mice, and wild pigs.",
        "The fossa is an ambush hunter; it uses its forelimbs and claws to catch its prey, killing it quickly with abite from its sharp teeth.",
        "Fossas use scent to communicate and keep track of each other, scent marking trees, rocks, or even just the ground with scent glands on the chest and under the base of the tail.",
        "They also make several kinds of sounds. Fossas mainly vocalize during the breeding season. Females mew to attract males, males howl and yowl when competing for a female. A fossa may roar to intimidate a fellow fossa or in defense.",
        "Fossas are ready to start their first family when they are about 4 years old.",
        "Fossas only come together to mate during the breeding season in September and October.",
        "After a gestation period that lasts for around 3 months, the female Fossa gives birth to 2 \u2013 6 cubs that are very underdeveloped at birth and do not open their eyes until they are between 2 and 3 weeks old.",
        "Fossa pups make a purring sound when nursing or near their mother.They also make a high-pitched noise called mewling to get the mother's attention.",

        "Fox are also fairly transient animals and frequently move from place to place.",
        "Foxes are omnivores animals and this means that they eat meat and vegetation.They eat small mammals, birds, reptiles, frogs, eggs, insects, worms, fish, crabs, mollusks, fruits, berries, vegetables, seeds, fungi and carrion. In winter they mainly eat mammals, such as mice, rabbits and other small animals.",
        "Foxes are primarily nocturnal animals that means they like to hunt at night .This means that they sleep during the day. This can change, though, depending on where the fox live.",
        "Foxes are great night-time predators because their eyes are specially adapted to night vision.",
        "Foxes are also very fast. They can run up to 65 kph (40 mph).",
        "A fox's den is normally a burrow underground, also known as an 'earth', but they can also live above ground in a cousy hollow. That provide a cool area to sleep, a good location to store food and a safe place to have their pups. Burrows are dug-out tunnels that have rooms for the fox and its family to live in. The burrows also have several exits so that they can flee if a predator enters the burrow.",
        "When raising their young, they live in small families\u2014called a \"leash of foxes\" or a \"skulk of foxes\"\u2014in underground burrows. Otherwise, they hunt and sleep alone.",

        "Frogs come in many sizes and colors.",
        "The goliath frog (Conraua goliath) is the largest living frog on Earth. Specimens can grow up to 32 centimeters (12.6 inches) in length from snout to vent, and weigh up to 3.25 kilogram (7.17 pounds).",
        "The smallest frog is the gold frog (Psyllophryne didactyla), which is a tiny 1 centimeters (0.39 inches) long and only about 1 gram (0.035 ounce).",
        "Adult frogs have two main color schemes. Each one signals a different survival technique. Those with bright colors (like poison frogs) advertise their presence and warn potential predators that their skin is toxic. Those with mottled green or brown colors are camouflaged so predators have a hard time finding them.",
        "Most species of frogs are nocturnal, but many others are diurnal.",
        "Frogs are solitary animals, though they aren't particularly territorial, except during the breeding season.",
        "Frogs have a moist and permeable skin layer covered with mucous glands; this allows them to breathe through their skin in addition to their lungs. The moisture on the skin dissolves oxygen from the air and water surrounding the frog and transmits it into the blood.",
        "Frog skin is water permiable, this means it can let water in and out. Frogs don't often drink with their mouths, they absorb water through their skin. They have a 'seat pouch', an area on their bellies which is designed for water absorbtion. They absorb through capillary action from water or a moist surface.",
        "Frogs are carnivores that eat live prey and do not feed on plants or carrion. Small to medium sized frogs eat insects such as flies, mosquitoes, moths and dragonflies. Larger frogs will eat larger insects like grasshoppers and worms. Some large frogs will even eat small snakes, mice, baby turtles, small fish, and even other smaller frogs!",
        "Frogs use their sticky, muscular tongue to catch and swallow food. Unlike humans, their tongue is not attached to the back of its mouth. Instead it is attached to the front, enabling the frog to stick its tongue out much further.",
        "Most frogs don't hunt, but wait for their prey to come close enough for them to attack; They can't chew their food and must swallow it whole.",
        "During extreme conditions, some frogs enter a state of torpor (state of decreased physiological activity) and remain inactive for months. In colder regions, many species of frog hibernate in winter.",
        "Some kinds of frogs can jump distances up to 20 times their own body length in a single leap. When disturbed, frogs often jump into a puddle or pond where they can hide underwater. Their erratic zig-zag jumping on land also serves to confuse potential predators.",
        "Frogs can see forwards, sideways and upwards all at the same time. They never close their eyes, even when they sleep. Frogs do, however, have eyelids that blink to protect their eyes from dirty residue and preserve moisture.",
        "Remarkably, frogs actually use their eyes to help them swallow food. When swallowing a big mouthful of food, a frog blinks its eyes. The blinking pushes the frogs huge eyeballs down on top of its mouth. This helps squeeze the food in its mouth into its throat.",
        "Frog ears are called tympanums and look more like a flat, disc-shaped patch of skin directly adjacent to each eye.",
        "In most frog species only the males croak. They croak to attract female frogs for breeding, and to warn away other male frogs from their territory. Many kinds of frogs puff themselves up enormously with air when they croak.",
        "Frogs become mature between two months to 3 years old. After a female frog becomes mature, she can lay from two to more than 50 thousands eggs at once, depending of species. Eggs will incubate for 48 hours to 23 days, submerged in water. During incubation, the male frog typically protects the eggs.",
        "Once an egg hatches, a small, legless, fish-like creature emerges. This frog offspring is called a tadpole. Tadpoles gradually grow legs, absorb their tails, lose their gills, and turn into frogs and toads that start breathing air and hopping. This whole transformation is called metamorphosis.",
        "Frogs have many predators. Animal predators include snakes, lizards, birds, shrews, raccoons, foxes, otters and weasels. Even under water frogs aren't safe from hungry fish, turtles and water birds.",
        "African frogs are the best jumpers of the frog world. They can hop 4.2 meters (14 feet) in a single bound.",
        "Waxy tree frogs don't hop but walk like a chameleon, using opposable first fingers and toes to grip branches.",

        "Like all penguin species, the ventral side of gentoo penguins is white while the dorsal side is black. This color pattern is known as countershading. This adaptation is useful while swimming underwater; the lightly colored ventral side helps penguins blend in with the sky for predators or prey that are looking up. The dark dorsal side blends in with the ocean floor for predators or prey looking down.",

        "Gila monsters are black, patterned along their backs with contrasting pink or orange. The bright colorsof these scales are thought to warn predators to stay away.",
        "Its venom is made by a row of glands in the lizard's lower jaw. When the lizard bites, small grooves in the teeth help the venom flow into its prey. The bite of a Gila monster is very strong, and the lizard may not loosen its grip for several seconds. It may even chew so that the venom goes deeper into the wound.",
        "Gila monster venom is about as toxic as that of a western diamondback rattlesnake. However, a relatively small amount of venom is introduced in a Gila bite.",
        "Currently, there is no antivenom for Gila monster bites. A Gila monster bite is painful to humans, butit rarely causes death. The biggest problem you might have if a Gila monster bit you is trying to get the lizard to release its grip! A strong stick to pry apart the jaws is recommended.",

        "Parental care is common, perhaps even ubiquitous among glass frogs, and males sometime guard multiple clutches. Small clutches of eggs are laid above the water on leaves, rocks, or bromeliads. When the type IV tadpoles hatch, they fall into the water below, and live in the muck and leaf litter on the bottoms of streams. Tadpoles living in oxygen-poor habitats are sometimes bright red as a result of blood flow close to the surface of their unpigmented skin.",
        "Average lifespan of glass frog is usually between 10 and 14 years in the wild.",

Few people today are aware of that craze, or the fruit which sparked it, since gooseberries went into a sharp decline and then, nearly out of fashion, after the First World War.",
        "The \"goose\" in \"gooseberry\" has usually been seen as a corruption of either the Dutch word kruisbes or the allied German Krausbeere, or of the earlier forms of the French groseille. Alternatively, the word has been connected to the Middle High German krus (curl, crisped), in Latin as grossularia.",
        "However, the Oxford English Dictionary takes the obvious derivation from goose and berry as probable because \"the grounds on which plants and fruits have received names associating them with animals are so often inexplicable that the inappropriateness in the meaning does not necessarily give good grounds for believing that the word is an etymological corruption\"."

        "Most species of grasshoppers have wings and can fly pretty well, using their large hind jumping legs as a booster to propel them into the air, where they spread their wings and take off. They can reach a speed of 13 kilometers (8 miles) per hour when flying.",
        "Grasshoppers are herbivores. Their favorite foods are plants in the grass family such as corn, wheat, barley and alfalfa. They aren't picky, however, and can eat many other types of plants. It's not uncommon to see grasshoppers chewing on the leaves of a tree, and more eating the grass beneath it.",
        "Grasshoppers peculiarly don't have nests, territories or a general home base as they usually migrate to find new sources of food.",

When they do meet or swim in groups, they typically avoid conflict and dominance battles. However, there are places, such as the waters around Africa, where great white sharks show a distinct hierarchy: females dominate males, larger sharks dominate smaller sharks, and residents dominate newcomers.",

They also eat nearly anything they can get their teeth into, such as small whales like Beluga whales, dolphins, other sharks, sea otters, sea turtles and even seabirds. The great white tends to hunt live prey, but it eats dead animals floating in the water as well when the opportunity presents itself.",
        "Little is known about the great white shark's mating habits. Great white sharks are ovoviviparous, which means eggs develop and hatch in the uterus and continue to develop until birth. The great white has an 11-month gestation period.",
        "When a great white shark is born, along with up to a dozen siblings, it immediately swims away from its mother. Baby sharks are on their own right from the start, and their mother may see them only as prey. At birth the baby shark is 1.2 to 1.5 meters (4 to 5 feet) long already.",

        "Hamsters have poor eyesight; they are nearsighted and colorblind. Equipped with an acute sense of smell, hamsters are able to distinguish each other by scent and, if handled often, also can recognize their owners by smell. They are particularly sensitive to high-pitched noises and can hear and communicate in the ultrasonic range. Also, there are sensory nerves on the end of each whisker, which help them to feel their surroundings and navigate in the dark.",

        "Hamsters are seasonal breeders and will produce several litters a year with several pups in each litter. The breeding season is from April to October in the Northern Hemisphere, with two to five litters of one to 13 young being born after a gestation period of 16 to 23 days. After the birth, the litter is blind until they are two weeks old and at 3 to 4 weeks the young are weaned.",

        "All members of a honey bee colony undergo complete metamorphosis, passing through the egg, larval and pupal stages before becoming adults.",
        "The number of individuals within a honey bee colony depends largely upon seasonal changes.",
        "Honey bees live on stored honey and pollen all winter, and they cluster into a ball to conserve warmth.",
        "Honey bees perform a group of movements, known as the waggle dance. They do this to inform other worker bees of the exact location of the food source. Some of these locations are over 6 kilometers (3.7 miles) from their hive.",
        "It is clear that honey bees use the sun to navigate and to communicate, but source of bees' knowledge of the sun's motion is still unclear. When navigating, the bees are able to use the sun as a fixed reference point. This allows them to fly in a compass direction simply by keeping the angle between their line of flight and the sun constant. Bees that have successfully found food are then able to share the location through their dance language.",
        "The Hive and the Honey Bee, the \"Bible\" of beekeeping, indicates that a bee's flight speed averages about 25 kilometers (15 miles) per hour and they're capable of flying 32 kilometers (20 miles) per hour.",
        " Honey bee beat their wings 230 times per second!",
        "Honey bees also collect pollen in their pollen baskets and carry it back to the hive. In the hive, pollen is used as a protein source necessary during brood-rearing.",
        " Honey bees are able to detect scents with their mouths, antennae and tips of their legs (tarsi). In all these areas bees have sensilla: tiny, hair-shaped organs that incorporate receptor nerve cells. They have 170 of these odor receptors in their antenna.",
        "All honey bees live in colonies where the workers sting intruders as a form of defense, and alarmed bees release a pheromone that stimulates the attack response in other bees.",
        "When a honey bee stings, it cannot pull the barbed stinger back out. It leaves behind not only the stinger, but also part of its abdomen and digestive tract, plus muscles and nerves. This massive abdominal rupture kills the honey bee. Honey bees are the only bees to die after stinging.",
        "Sadly, over the past 20 years, colonies of bees have been disappearing, and the reason remains unknown. Referred to as 'colony collapse disorder', billions of Honey bees across the world are leaving their hives, never to return. In some regions, up to 90% of bees have disappeared!",

The largest and most massive species appears to be the southern ground hornbill which has an average weight of 3.8 kg (8.3 lb), and can weigh up to 6.3 kg (14 lb) and span about 180 cm (6 feet) across the wings.",
        "Hornbills have a long tail, broad wings, and white and black, brown, or gray feathers. This contrasts with the brightly colored neck, face, bill, and casque in many species. Females and males often have different colored faces and eyes.",
        "The most distinctive feature of the hornbills is the heavy bill, supported by powerful neck muscles as well as by the fused vertebrae. The large bill assists in fighting, preening, constructing the nest, and catching prey.",
        "A feature unique to the hornbills is the casque, a hollow structure that runs along the upper mandible. In some species it is barely perceptible and appears to serve no function beyond reinforcing the bill.",
        "Several species, including the striking Rhinoceros hornbill, possess a brightly coloured beak and casque. This striking coloration is the result of the bird rubbing its beak and casque against the preen gland beneath the tail, which stimulates the production of an oily orange-red fluid that adds areddish tone to these parts.",
        "The casque of the helmeted hornbill from Borneo is different from all other hornbill species: its dense, ivory-like casque makes up about 10 percent of the bird's body weight! Unfortunately, this has made it attractive to native islanders who kill the birds to use the heavy casques for ornamentalcarvings.",
        "Hornbills are diurnal, generally travelling in pairs or small family groups. Larger flocks sometimes form outside the breeding season. The largest assemblies of hornbills form at some roosting sites, where as many as 2400 individual birds may be found.",
        "Southern ground hornbill booms are so loud they are sometimes mistaken for the roaring of lions.",
        "Often the first sign of an approaching hornbill is the rhythmic chuffing sound made by their wings as they fly through the air, which can be heard at long range.",
        "Hornbills generally form monogamous pairs, although some species engage in cooperative breeding.",
        "The female hornbill lays her eggs in a hole in a tree. Then, helped by her mate, she seals herself in, covering the entrance with droppings and mud. Only a small slit is left, through which the male gives her food. This keeps the nest safe from snakes until the chicks are grown enough to leave the nest, and learn how to fly.",
        "The beaks of toucans and hornbills are an example of what scientists call convergent evolution. While hornbills live in Africa and Asia, toucans live in Central and South America. Essentially, hornbills and toucans adapted to their different environments in the same way, developing similar traits. That makes them appear related.",
        "The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species notes that the overwhelming majority of hornbills are not in danger of becoming extinct.",

        "Insects have many different ways of communicating. They communicate through touch with their antennae and mouths; visually through combinations of flashes of light and combinations of colour; they make sounds to attract others of their own species or to send out signals to other species; and by smell: they produce chemicals called pheromones to send signals to within a species and chemicals called allomones for the warning signals that insects send out to other species.",

        "Like many other parrots, kakapo have a variety of calls. As well as the booms and chings of their mating calls, they will often loudly skraark.",
        "Females nest in holes in the ground. The female kakapo lays 1\u20134 eggs per breeding cycle, with several days between eggs. She nests on the ground under the cover of plants or in cavities such as hollow tree trunks.",
        "The female incubates the eggs faithfully, but is forced to leave them every night in search of food. Predators are known to eat the eggs, and the embryos inside can also die of cold in the mother's absence. Kakapo eggs usually hatch within 30 days, bearing fluffy grey chicks that are quite helpless. After the eggs hatch, the female feeds the chicks for three months, and the chicks remain with the female for some months after fledging.",
        "The kakapo only breed every 2 to 4 years when rimu trees produce a bumper crop of fruit, and even when they do mate, less than 50 percent of the eggs are fertile, likely because of inbreeding.",
        "Kakapo means 'night parrot' in the Maori language.",
        "Like many other New Zealand bird species, the kakapo was historically important to M\u0101ori, the indigenous people of New Zealand, appearing in many of their traditional legends and folklore \u2013 however it was also heavily hunted and used as a resource by M\u0101ori, both for its meat as a food source and for its feathers, which were used to make highly valued pieces of clothing. Kakapo were also occasionally kept as pets.",
        "Before the arrival of humans, the kakapo was distributed throughout both main islands of New Zealand.",
        "In Fiordland, areas of avalanche and slip debris with regenerating and heavily fruiting vegetation \u2013 such as five finger, wineberry, bush lawyer, tutu, hebes, and coprosmas \u2013 became known as \"kakapo gardens\".",
        "The kakapo is critically endangered \u2013 the total known adult population is about 200 living individuals, all of which are named and tagged, confined to four small islands off the coast of New Zealand that have been cleared of predators.",
        "The introduction of predators such as cats, rats, ferrets, and stoats during British colonisation almost wiped out the kakapo.",
        "Conservation efforts began in the 1890s, but they were not very successful until the implementation of the Kakapo Recovery Programme in 1995.",
        "The conservation of the kakapo has made the species well known. Many books and documentaries detailing the plight of the kakapo have been produced in recent years.",
        "Today, most kakapo are kept on two predator-free islands, Codfish / Whenua Hou and Anchor, where they are closely monitored, and Little Barrier / Hauturu Island is being trialled as a third home for thespecies."

        "Killer whales have a large dorsal fin up to 1.8 meters (5.9 feet) tall. Like the keel of a boat, the dorsal fin may help stabilize a killer whale as it swims at high speeds, but a fin is not essential to a whale's balance.",
        "A killer whales uses its rounded, paddlelike pectoral flippers to steer and, with the help of the flukes, to stop. A killer whale's pectoral flipper contains 5 digits much like the fingers on a human hand.",
        "A killer whale's skin is smooth. The outer layer continually and rapidly renews itself, and the old skin sloughs off. Smooth skin increases swimming efficiency.",
        "Killer whales engage in frequent behaviour at the surface such as breaching (jumping completely out of the water) and tail-slapping. These activities may have a variety of purposes, such as courtship, communication, dislodging parasites, or play.",
        "The killer whale's large size and strength make it among the fastest marine mammals, able to reach speeds in excess of 56 kilometer (35 miles) per hour.",
        "Killer whales depend heavily on underwater sound for orientation, feeding, and communication. They produce three categories of sounds: clicks, whistles, and pulsed calls. Clicks are believed to be used primarily for navigation and discriminating prey and other objects in the surrounding environment, but are also commonly heard during social interactions.",
        "Killer whales have a diverse diet, although individual populations often specialize in particular types of prey. Some feed exclusively on fish, while others hunt marine mammals such as seals, dugongs and dolphins.",
        "On average, a killer whale eats 227 kilograms (500 lb) each day.",

If they were longer, they would penetrate the floor of its mouth. Angled back into the snake's mouth, the fangs help push the prey on its path to the stomach.",
        "King cobras can be distinguished from other cobras by size and hood. King cobras are generally larger than other cobras, and the stripe on the neck is a chevron instead of a double or single eye shape that may be seen in most of the other Asian cobras. Moreover, the hood of the king cobra is narrower and longer.",

        "If it feels threatened, the king cobra flares its hood, makes a growling hiss, and rears itself up. ",
        "The hiss of the king cobra is a much lower pitch than many other snakes and many people thus liken its call to a \"growl\" rather than a hiss. A growling hiss works much the same way as the rattle of the rattlesnake works: it is a warning sign that can be heard at a safe distance. It is produced by tiny holes in the trachea and is resonated by the lung.",
        "The venom of the king cobra consists primarily of neurotoxins, with several other compounds. Though there are other snakes with more potent venom, the amount of neurotoxin that a king cobra can emit in one bite is enough to kill 20 people or one elephant.",

        "The king cobra is an active hunter and is active during the day (diurnal).",
        "King cobras are carnivorous snakes and feed on other snakes (even venomous ones!), lizards, frogs and small mammals. They also eat a variety of birds, eggs, fish and chickens stolen from poultry farms.",
        "King cobras are the only snakes in the world that build a nest for their young. They can have between 20 to 40 eggs in a nest and the female guards the eggs faithfully, which can take 60 to 90 days to hatch. When the eggs start to hatch, instinct causes the female to leave the nest and find prey to eat so she does not eat her young.",
        "The baby king cobras, with an average length of 45 to 55 cm (18 to 22 in), have venom which is as potent as that of the adults. They may be brightly marked, but these colours often fade as they mature.",

According to a myth, the picture of the killer of a king cobra stays in the eyes of the snake, which is later picked up by the partner and is used to hunt down the killer for revenge. Because of this myth, whenever a cobra is killed, especially in India, the head is either crushed or burned to damage the eyes completely.",
        "Another myth claims that only 100 people may cast eyes on a king cobra; any more and it will die. It says that only king cobras who are ready to pass on to the next life will enter settlements so they can be viewed by more than 100.",

        "The Komodo dragon (Varanus komodoensis), also known as the Komodo monitor, is the largest living species of lizard.",
        "Komodo dragons live on only five islands in southeastern Indonesia: Indonesia's four islands within Komodo National Park (Komodo, Rinca, Gili Montang, Gili Dasami), and the island of Flores. The islands are volcanic in origin, rugged and hilly, and covered with both forest and savanna grassland.",
        "Adult Komodo dragons live mainly in tropical savannah forests. They prefer open lowland areas with tall grasses and bushes, but are also found in other habitats, such as beaches, ridge tops, and dry riverbeds. Young Komodo dragons are arboreal and live in forested regions until they are eight months old.",
        "The average lifespan of the Komodo dragon is about 30 years in the wild.",
        "Komodo dragons are gray, brown or reddish in color, depending on their location. Their robust bodies are uniformly covered in rough scales. They have strong limbs and a powerful, muscular tail.",
        "The heads of Komodo dragons have a rounded snout and ear openings. Their skulls are flexible and have about 60 short sharp, serrated teeth designed to cut and tear flesh.",
        "Komodo dragons are able to run at speeds of up to 20 km/h (12.4 mph), but tire quickly.",
        "Komodo dragons are mostly active during the day but have shown some nocturnal behaviour.",
        "The Komodo dragon uses its tongue to detect, taste, and smell stimuli, as with many other reptiles, with the vomeronasal sense using the Jacobson's organ, rather than using the nostrils. With the help of a favorable wind and its habit of swinging its head from side to side as it walks, a Komodo dragon may be able to detect carrion from 4 to 9.5 km (2.5 to 5.9 mi) away.",
        "Komodo dragons are carnivores (meat-eaters), and will first scavenge carrion before killing for food.",
        "They are such fierce hunters they can eat very large prey, such as large water buffalo, horse, deer, goats, pigs and even humans. They will also eat other reptiles (including smaller Komodo dragons), birds, bird eggs, small mammals and monkeys.",
        "Young Komodo dragons spend much of their first few years in trees, where they are relatively safe from predators, including cannibalistic adults, as juvenile dragons make up 10% of their diets. Juveniles feed on grasshoppers, beetles, small geckos, eggs, birds, and eventually small mammals.",
        "Komodo dragons are the top predators in their range, and adults do not suffer predation by any species. Young Komodo dragons sometimes fall prey to predatory mammals, birds and other Komodo dragons.",
        "The Komodo dragon is a vulnerable species and is on the IUCN Red List. The Komodo National Park was founded in 1980 to protect Komodo dragon populations on islands including Komodo, Rinca, and Padar. Later, the Wae Wuul and Wolo Tado Reserves were opened on Flores to aid with Komodo dragon conservation.",
        "The World Animal Foundation estimates the number of Komodo dragons in the wild to be 6 thousands.",
        "Komodo dragons have long been great zoo attractions, where their size and reputation make them popular exhibits. They are, however, rare in zoos because they are susceptible to infection and parasitic disease if captured from the wild, and do not readily reproduce.",
        "In the wild, there are four times as many male Komodo dragons as there are females.",
        "Komodo dragons have the smallest home range of any large predator in the world!",

        "Lemmings are herbivores. Their diets consist primarily of moss and grass, but they may also eat some berries, bulbs and lichens.",
        "The food that lemmings eat is not very nutritious, so lemmings must eat lots of it. In fact, they may spend six or more hours every day searching for and eating food.",
        "Lemmings exhibit both diurnal and nocturnal active, often active both night and day.",
        "Lemmings dig burrows in the snow. Living beneath the snow functions to keep them safe from predators. It also keep them warm, as underground temperatures are typically higher than air temperatures.",
        "Their underground burrows have rest areas, bathrooms and nesting rooms. Lemmings make nests out of grasses, feathers and musk ox wool.",
        "Female lemmings give birth to the baby lemmings after a gestation period of around three weeks. Baby lemmings are born in burrows under the snow which helps to keep the baby lemmings warm and away from the Arctic winter. The mother lemming gives birth to around 7 baby lemmings and feeds the baby lemmings on her milk until they are big enough and strong enough to start looking for food by themselves.",
        "Like all rodents, lemmings have a high reproductive rate and can breed rapidly when food is plentiful.",
        "With populations reproducing very quickly, lemmings are an important food resource for predators in their area, including foxes, weasels, hawks, and owls.",
        "Although lemmings are similar to other rodents, they differ in their bright colors and aggressiveness toward predators.",
        "When population of lemmings in certain area becomes too large, they migrate in large numbers toward new areas to find food.",
        "Lemmings can swim and may choose to cross a body of water in search of a new habitat. In such cases, many may drown if the body of water is so wide as to stretch their physical capability to the limit.",
        "Contrary to popular belief, lemmings do not commit mass suicide when they migrate. It is a misconception fuelled by the media and video game industries.",
        "In 1955, Carl Barks drew an Uncle Scrooge adventure comic with the title \"The Lemming with the Locket.\" This comic, which was inspired by a 1953 American Mercury article, showed massive numbers of lemmings jumping over Norwegian cliffs.",
        "Even more influential was a Disney movie called \"White Wilderness,\" which won an Academy Award for Documentary Feature, in which staged footage was shown with lemmings jumping into certain death after faked scenes of mass migration.",

        "All lizards grow continuously throughout their lives, however their skin does not grow to accommodate their changing size. It is for this reason that they must shed their skin regularly to allow for proper growth. This process is known as ecdysis.",
        "Most lizards live on the ground, but others can be found making their home in a tree, burrow, or in the water.",
        "Different lizard species eat different types of food. Some are predators, eating mammals, birds, and other reptiles. Others are mainly vegetarian, eating leaves, fruits, and flowers. But most lizards are insect eaters, grabbing crickets, flies, grasshoppers, and more with long, sticky tongues or quick bites.",
        "There are only two lizard species around the world that produced venom, the gila monster [pic. below] and the Mexican beaded lizard.",
        "Most lizards are oviparous (egg laying) though some species give birth to live young because the eggs develop inside the mother. Parthenogenesis in squamata (that is, asexual reproduction) occurs in about 50 species of lizard and it is believed that female ability to do this in the absence of males is widespread among lizards.",

        "Llamas were domesticated by the Incas 4 thousands to 5 thousands years ago.",
        "Today llamas live throughout the Americas, Europe and Australia as domesticated livestock.",
        "Llamas typically live for 15 to 25 years, with some individuals surviving 30 years or more.",
        "The height of a full-grown, full-size llama is 1.7 to 1.8 meters (5.6 to 5.9 feet) tall at the top of the head, and can weigh between 130 and 200 kilograms (290 and 440 pounds).",

        "When one llama has an issue with another llama, it will stick its tongue out to express its displeasure. They'll also spit on other llamas.",
        "Llamas are herbivores. Llamas eat grass, hay, and grain, and as browsers, also like bark and twigs. For treats they love cut up apples and carrots.",
        "Llamas are very strong and durable animals. They can carry up to 34 kilograms (75 pounds) and walk about 32 kilometers (20 miles) a day carrying that load.",
        "They are willing pack animals but only to a point. An overloaded llama will simply refuse to move. These animals often lie down on the ground and they may spit, hiss, or even kick at their owners until their burden is lessened.",
        "Llamas do not have specific time of mating.",
        "The llama gestation period is around 11.5 months (350 days). Baby llamas are called crias, and mothers usually have just one; twin births are rare.",
        "Predators of the llamas are mountain lions and wild dogs. If they are attacked, the male llamas sound off a warning so that the rest of the herd can run away.",
        "Llamas have a domesticated cousin, the alpaca, and wild cousins the guanacos and vicu\u00f1as.",
        "Llamas contribute much more than transportation to the human communities in which they live. Leather is made from their hides, and their wool is crafted into ropes, rugs, and fabrics. Llama dung makes great fuel\u2014and fertilizer. In fact, it may have helped the Incans grow corn and survive in the Andes.",

        "Most lobsters are 25 to 50 centimeters (10 to 20 inches) in length.",
        "Lobsters have long bodies with muscular tails used for swimming; flexure of the tail and abdomen propel the animal backward.",
        "They have a tough exoskeleton, which protects them. Like most arthropods, lobsters must molt in order to grow, leaving them vulnerable during this time. During the molting process, several species may experience a change in color.",
        "Lobsters have compound eyes on movable stalks, pair of long antennae, and three pairs of swimming legs (swimmerets) on the elongated abdomen.",
        "Typically, lobsters are dark colored, either bluish green or greenish brown as to blend in with the ocean floor, but they can be found in a multitude of colors.",
        "Highly prized as seafood, lobsters are economically important, and are often one of the most profitable commodities in coastal areas they populate.",
        "Lobster has traditionally been a plentiful food item, so plentiful in fact that it also served as bait to catch fish prior to the end of the 19th century.",
        "In North America, the American lobster did not achieve popularity until the mid-19th century, when New Yorkers and Bostonians developed a taste for it, and commercial lobster fisheries only flourished after the development of the lobster smack, a custom-made boat with open holding wells on the deck to keep the lobsters alive during transport.",
        "Prior to this time, lobster was considered a poverty food or as a food for indentured servants or lower members of society in Maine, Massachusetts, and the Canadian Maritimes. Some servants specified in employment agreements that they would not eat lobster more than twice per week, however there is limited evidence for this. Lobster was also commonly served in prisons, much to the displeasure of inmates.",
        "According to Guinness World Records, the largest lobster ever caught was in Nova Scotia, Canada, weighing 20.15 kilograms (44.4 lb).",
        "Lobsters are closely related to shrimp and crabs.",

    "Locust": [
        "Locust is the common name for any member of several species of short-horned grasshoppers of the family Acrididae.",
        "Locusts are normally solitary and actively avoid contact with each other. But when conditions are right, particularly after lots of rain, contact becomes unavoidable. As the insects bump against one another, they begin to change. In an hour or so they become attracted to each other and swarm together.",
        "During the course of one or two successive generations they actually change in shape and color, becoming bold yellow or green rather than the neutral brown of solitary locusts. These two phases look so different that until the 1920s, scientists believed they were actually two separate species.",
        "Locusts are found on all continents except Antarctica and North America. They are most common in Africa and Asia.",
        "Locusts diet \u2013 Large swarms of locusts can completely strip the foliage and stems of plants such as forbs and grasses. Some species consume a variety of plants, while others have a more specific diet. They often eat dry plant matter on the ground and will forage for weak or dead grasshoppers when plant food is scarce.",
        "The desert locust is probably the best known species. It inhabits dry grasslands and deserts from Africa to the Punjab (state in northern India) and can fly upward to about 1 thousands meters (5 thousands feet) in huge towers of individuals. They gather in swarms larger than any other single congregation of organisms on Earth, ranging from 100 thousands to 10 billion insects. One swarm in 1794 once spread over 5 thousands square kilometers (almost 2 thousands square miles).",
        "The Rocky Mountain locust a species that is now extinct, destroyed millions of dollars worth of crops on the Great Plains between 1874 and 1877; they became extinct in 1902.",
        "In 1954, a swarm of locusts flew from Africa all the way to Great Britain, decimating crops along the way. Another swarm in 1988 made it from Africa to the Caribbean.",
        "When locusts rub against each other, the contact increases serotonin levels. The normally shy and solitary insects become social and crave more contact with others. Scientists discovered artificially increasing locusts' serotonin levels in a lab environment caused the transformations in appearance and behavior seen in swarm development. In contrast, blocking serotonin kept the insects calm despite contact with others.",
        "Unlike other insects such as butterflies and houseflies, locusts do not undergo a complete metamorphosis. Locusts go through egg, nymph and adult stages \u2014 lacking the pupa stage. Fledgling is an intermediate stage that occurs between the nymph and adult periods. Their life cycle period varies depending on the species of the locust.",
        "The words \"lobster\" and \"locust\" are both derived from the Vulgar Latin locusta, which was originally used to refer to various types of crustaceans and insects.",
        "Study of literature shows how pervasive plagues of locusts were over the course of history. The insects arrived unexpectedly, often after a change of wind direction or weather, and the consequences were devastating.",

It has long, thick, light-colored fur that is silky in the winter and shorter, thinner, and darker-colored in the summer. Large paws with fur on the soles give Eurasian lynx traction;long legs also help when walking in deep snow.",

        "Bobcats are found throughout North America from southern Canada to southern Mexico. The bobcat is known by lots of names: wildcat, bay lynx, and lynx cat. Bobcats look very similar to Canadian lynx. But bobcats have smaller feet and don't have the furry soles of the other lynx, so they are not as well equipped to live in areas of heavy snow.",

        "Macaroni penguins moult once a year, a process in which they replace all of their old feathers. They spend around two weeks accumulating fat before moulting because they do not feed during the moult, as they cannot enter the water to forage for food without feathers. The process typically takes three to four weeks, which they spend sitting ashore. Once finished, they go back to sea and return to their colonies to mate in the spring.",

        "Manatees inhabit the shallow, marshy coastal areas and rivers of the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico ( West Indian manatee), the Amazon basin (Amazonian manatee), and West Africa (West African manatee).",
        "Manatees are long-lived and reproduce slowly. Age estimates based on growth rings in ear bones indicate life spans of up to 60 years, and at least one manatee has survived more than 70 years in captivity.",
        "Manatees weigh 400 to 550 kilograms (880 to 1 thousands lb), and average 2.8 to 3 meters (9.2 to 9.8 feet) in length, sometimes growing to 4.6 meters (15 feet) and 1 thousands kilograms (3 thousands pounds). The females tend to be larger and heavier.",
        "Dull gray, blackish, or brown in color, all three manatee species have stout tapered bodies ending in a flat rounded tail used for forward propulsion.",
        "Manatees are excellent swimmers, able to stay submerged for more than 15 minutes, but they are incapable of travelling on land.",
        "Overall, manatees appear slow moving and cumbersome, but they are graceful and can be swift underwater. Manatees usually travel at about 8 kilometers per hour (5 miles per hour), but in a pinch they can pick up the pace to 24 kilometers per hour (15 miles per hour). They often linger near the surface of the water, where they can suffer collisions with speedboats and other vessels.",
        "While a manatee's eyes may appear small, their vision is acute. They are able to distinguish different sized objects, colors, and patterns.",
        "While sensory systems of manatees have not been well studied, their large inner ear bones may indicate their underwater communication. The animals emit chirps, whistles, and squeaks to reach out to others.",
        "Manatees are uniquely adapted for eating aquatic plants. The manatee's large lips are prehensile and studded with specialized sensory bristles and hairs (vibrissae) for discriminating between and manipulating food plants.",
        "Compared with the fish and krill eaten by other marine mammals, most aquatic plants are low in energy value and protein. Manatees must therefore eat large amounts of this bulky, low-energy food to satisfy their dietary requirements. An adult manatee will commonly eat about 10% to 15% of their body weight (about 50 kg 110 pounds) per day. To handle such a diet, manatees are hindgut digesters (like horses) and have intestines as long as 30 meters (100 feet).",
        "The teeth have also evolved in response to dietary demands. To counter abrasion from ingested sand and silica, manatees constantly grow new molars. These teeth progress from the rear of the jaws forward as older, worn teeth drop out at the front of the mouth. Unlike almost all other mammals, tooth replacement occurs throughout life.",
        "Manatee brains are smooth (other animals, including humans have cortical folds) and its ratio of brain size to body size is the lowest of any mammal.",
        "Manatees are active day and night and can sleep submerged or while breathing at the water's surface.",

        "The giant oceanic manta ray spend most of its life far from land travelling with the currents and migrating to areas where upwellings of nutrient-rich water increase the availability of zooplankton. The oceanic manta ray is often in association with offshore oceanic islands.",
        "Compared to the giant oceanic manta ray, the reef manta ray tends to be found in shallower, more coastal habitats, but local migrations are sometimes reported.",
        "Despite their status as an ocean giant, manta rays feed on some of the smallest organisms in the sea! They are planktivores, feeding especially on zooplankton; tiny animals such copepods, mysid shrimps and arrow worms. Mantas are known to make seasonal migrations in order to take advantage of particularly abundant areas of food.",
        "Manta rays are ovoviviparous. The female gives birth to live offspring, but these develop in eggs inside the mother. After a gestation period of twelve to thirteen months, the female manta rays give birth to a single pup (although occasionally they may also give birth to twins), which measures roughly 1.5 meters (5 feet) across from wing-tip to wing-tip at birth.",

        "Few mammals could survive extended periods in underground tunnels without a regular source of oxygen. Moles, however, show no adverse affects when exposed to high levels of carbon dioxide, or conversely, low levels of oxygen, for long periods of time. Specialized blood cells affect the way hemoglobin binds to carbon dioxide, allowing them to breathe in the same air they just breathed out without any ill effects.",

        "Monitor lizards are oviparous, laying from 7 to 37 eggs, which they often cover with soil or protect in a hollow tree stump. Some monitor lizards, including the Komodo dragon, are capable of parthenogenesis (a natural form of asexual reproduction).",
        "According to IUCN Red List of threatened species, most of the Monitor lizards species fall in the categories of least concern but the population is decreasing globally.",
        "In English, they are known as \"monitors\" or \"monitor lizards\". The earlier term \"monitory lizard\" became rare by about 1920. The name may have been suggested by the occasional habit of varanids to stand on their two hind legs and to appear to \"monitor\", or perhaps from their supposed habit of \"warning persons of the approach of venomous animals\".",
        "Monitor lizards have become a staple in the reptile pet trade. The most commonly kept monitors are the savannah monitor and Ackies monitor, due to their relatively small size, low cost, and relatively calm dispositions with regular handling.",
        "The skin of monitor lizards is used in making a carnatic music percussion instrument called a kanjira. It is an instrument of the tambourine family."

        "There are a few characteristics that are different between the Old World and New World monkeys: The noses of New World monkeys are flatter than the narrow noses of the Old World monkeys, and have side-facing nostrils. Old World monkeys don't have prehensile tails; New World monkeys do. Old World monkeys have cheek pouches, where food is stuffed on the run so it can be chewed later; New World monkeys don't have cheek pouches. Old World monkeys have sitting pads on their rumps, but New World monkeys do not.",

        "The gestation period lasts between 134 to 237 days, depending on the species. Most monkeys give birth to only one baby at a time.",
        "Once born, baby monkeys are primarily cared for by their mother. If the monkeys are monogamous, the baby monkey may be cared for by both parents. Many times, a young monkey will ride on its mother's back or hang from her neck. The baby is considered an adult between four and five years old.",

        "On average, an adult moose stands 1.4\u20132.1 meters (4.6\u20136.9 feet) high at the shoulder. Males normally weigh from 380 to 700 kilograms (838 to 1 thousands pounds) and females typically weigh 200 to 490 kilograms (441 to 1 thousands pounds). The head-and-body length is 2.4\u20133.1 meters (7.9\u201310.2 ft), with the vestigial tail adding only a further 5\u201312 centimeters (2.0\u20134.7 inches).",

        "Unlike most hooved, domesticated animals, moose cannot digest hay, and feeding it to a moose can be fatal. The moose's varied and complex diet is typically expensive for humans to provide, and free-range moose require a lot of forested acreage for sustainable survival, which is one of the main reasons moose have never been widely domesticated.",
        "Moose are excellent swimmers and are known to wade into water to eat aquatic plants both at and below the surface.",

        "Moose are not usually aggressive towards humans, but can be provoked or frightened to behave with aggression. In terms of raw numbers, they attack more people than bears and wolves combined, but usually with only minor consequences. In the Americas, moose injure more people than any other wild mammal, and worldwide, only hippopotamuses injure more."

        "The largest moth in the world is the Atlas moth (Attacus atlas), with wingspan of up to 30 cm (12 inches) and a surface area of 400 square centimeters (62 square inches). It is found in the tropical and subtropical forests of Southeast Asia.",
        "Moths have wings that are covered with tiny scales. Each scale has a color, and together they give these insects their amazing wing patterns. Color patterns vary a lot, but they are usually either camouflaged or bright with warning colors.",
        "Some moths are notorious for their ability to impersonate other animals. To avoid being eaten, some moths have evolved to look like less palatable insects, such as wasps, tarantulas and the praying mantis. Some moths even mimic bird droppings.",
        "The Madagascan sunset moth (Chrysiridia rhipheus) is considered one of the most impressive and appealing-looking lepidopterans. Famous worldwide, it is featured in most coffee table books on Lepidoptera and is much sought after by collectors.",

        "A truly bizarre group of moths, Calyptra, can actually suck blood! The common name of many of these species, vampire moth, refers to the habit that they have of drinking blood from vertebrates. According to a recent study, some of them (C. thalictri) are even capable of drinking human blood through skin.",
        "This has worked out pretty well for them for 190 thousands thousands years, but in the past 50-75 years man-made lights have made things occasionally confusing for them. Before that, the only thing that would confuse them would be rare small fires. (If a moth is in the middle of a forest fire, navigation is the least of its problems.) And, again, even there many of the confused moths would not be harmed, but would merely orbit in circles or outward spirals until the fire died out.",
        "Moths usualy use chemical senses to find each other in the dark. Some male moths can smell a single female from 11 kilometers (7 miles) away.",
        "Many birds rely on moth caterpillars for food, especially for feeding their chicks. Night-flying moths are a vital food source for bats. Moths and caterpillars are also eaten by many other animals, including other insects, spiders, frogs, toads, lizards and small mammals (such as hedgehogs).",
        "Some species of moths are major agricultural pests. Their caterpillars eat crop plants. Some get in stored food like grain, or eat wool and fur.",

        "Silk is produced by several insects, but generally only the silk of moth caterpillars has been used for textile manufacturing.",
        "Some species of moth do not have mouth in the adult stage. They have short lifespan and their only purpose is to reproduce and lay eggs.",
        "Moths evolved long before butterflies, fossils having been found that may be 190 million years old.",
        "Although the rules for distinguishing moths from butterflies are not well established, one very good guiding principle is that butterflies have thin antennae and have small balls or clubs at the end of their antennae. Moth antennae can be quite varied in appearance, but in particular lack the club end.",
        "Also butterflies hold their wings up and down over their backs, while moths usually hold them folded down flat.",

        "Mourning doves generally eat enough to fill their crops and then fly away to digest while resting.",
        "Like other dove, the mourning dove drinks by suction, without lifting or tilting its head. It often gathers at drinking spots around dawn and dusk.",
        "The mourning dove is monogamous and forms strong pair bonds. Pairs typically reconvene in the same area the following breeding season, and sometimes may remain together throughout the winter.",
        "Female mourning doves generally lay two small, white eggs in an open nest. Both sexes incubate, the male from morning to afternoon, and the female the rest of the day and at night. Mourning doves are devoted parents; nests are very rarely left unattended by the adults.",
        "Adult mourning doves will try to lure predators away from their nests by pretending to be injured. This is called the \"broken-wing feign.\" They flutter about on the ground in front of the predator, as if they had a broken wing, and lure them away from the area of their nest.",

        "Mule deer forage for a wide variety of plants that differ with geographical ranges and seasonally depending on what resources are available. They are generally considered browsers, eating twigs and other vegetative parts of woody plants, but they also eat different grasses.",
        "Mule deer have excellent hearing and eyesight that warns them of approaching dangers.",
        "Mating season occurs in autumn when does come into estrus for a period lasting only several days. The gestation period is approximately 200 days, with fawns arriving in the spring; the young will remain with mothers throughout the summer and become weaned in the autumn. Mule deer females usually give birth to two fawns, although if it is their first time having a fawn, they often only have one.",
        "Besides humans, the three leading predators of mule deer are coyotes, wolves, and cougars. Bobcats, Canadian lynxes, wolverines, American black bears, and brown bears may prey upon adult deer, but most often only attack fawns or infirm specimens or eat the deer after it has died naturally.",
        "Mule deer populations have been restored since severe depletion by market hunting took place at the end of the 19th century.",
        "Mule deer have been introduced to Argentina and Hawaii.",
        "The mule deer and the white-tailed deer are very similar in appearance. The most noticeable differences between white-tailed and mule deer are the size of their ears, the color of their tails, and the configuration of their antlers. The mule deer's tail is black-tipped, whereas the whitetail's is not. Mule deer antlers are bifurcated; they \"fork\" as they grow, rather than branching from a single main beam, as is the case with white-tails."

        "The muskrat is the only species in genus Ondatra and tribe Ondatrini.",
        "Muskrats are referred to as \"rats\" in a general sense because they are medium-sized rodents with an adaptable lifestyle and an omnivorous diet. They are not, however, members of the genus Rattus.",
        "Muskrats provide an important food resource for many other animals, including mink, foxes, coyotes, wolves, lynx, bears, eagles, snakes, alligators, and large owls and hawks. Otters, snapping turtles, and large fish such as pike prey on baby muskrats.",
        "Muskrats are widespread and abundant. Populations remain stable even when they are being hunted for fur, affected by disease, or a target for large predator populations because muskrats have the ability to reproduce quickly.",
        "Historically, the muskrat was trapped for its thick and durable coat, and it is still sought by the fur trade.",

In summer months they move closer to coasts, usually in pods of 10\u2013100 . In the winter, they move to offshore, deeper waters under thick pack ice, surfacing in narrow fissures in the sea ice, or leads.",
        "When in their wintering waters, narwhals make some of the deepest dives recorded for a marine mammal, diving to at least 800 meters (2 thousands feet) over 15 times per day, with many dives reaching 1 thousands meters (4 thousands feet). Dives to these depths last around 25 minutes, including the time spent at the bottom and the transit down and back from the surface.",

The breeding period is in early spring (March-April) in the dense ice of their wintering grounds. The gestation period is about 14 months and they give birth in late spring (May-June) during their northbound migration to their summering grounds.",

        "The highest point in the province of Newfoundland and Labrador is Mount Caubvick, at 1 thousands meters (5 thousands feet). This mountain, however, is in the Labrador section of the province. The highest point on the island of Newfoundland is a mountain called the Cabox, at 812 meters (2 thousands feet).",
        "A large part of the island of Newfoundland is an extension of the Appalachian system. Major bays, peninsulas, river systems and mountain ranges are typically oriented southwest to northeast, parallel to the Appalachians.",

        "Cape Spear Lighthouse National Historic Site, 11 kilometers south of St. John's, is the most easterly point in North America, and has Newfoundland's oldest lighthouse. It is a popular, if chilly, spot to watch the sunrise as well as sight whales, seabirds, and icebergs. Dating from 1835, the light station was in operation until 1955 and is now an interesting museum. In addition, there are massive half-ruined gun emplacements from the Second World War, including the barrels of two guns each weighing 30 tons and having a range of 13 kilometers.",
        "L'Anse aux Meadows is an archaeological site on the northernmost tip of the Great Northern Peninsula on the island of Newfoundland in the Canadian province of Newfoundland and Labrador. Archaeological evidence of a Norse presence was discovered at L'Anse aux Meadows in the 1960s. It is the only confirmed Norse or Viking site in North America outside of the settlements found in Greenland. It was named a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1978.",
        "The Rooms is a cultural facility in St. John's. The facility opened in 2005 and houses the Art Gallery of Newfoundland and Labrador, the Provincial Archives of Newfoundland and Labrador and the Provincial Museum of Newfoundland and Labrador.

        "All newts are carnivorous. They feed on small invertebrates such as insects, worms, snails, and slugs.",
        "Many species of newts have poison glands in their skin which helps to protect them against predators. They have bright skin colors as a warning to other animals.",
        "Most newt species are nocturnal.",
        "All larval newts possess gills to breathe underwater, when they reach adulthood they loose the gills and grow lungs. Adult newts can breathe underwater by extracting oxygen through their skin.",
        "Newts are threatened by habitat loss, fragmentation and pollution. Several species are endangered, and at least one species, the Yunnan lake newt, has gone extinct recently.",
        "The labels of newt and salamander are often used interchangeably, and it's easy to understand why some people think these two distinct amphibians are the same animal. Essentially, all newts are salamanders, but not all salamanders are newts.",
        "The oldest form of the name newt is considered to be eft, which is still used for newly metamorphosed juveniles. According to some reports, it changed for unknown reasons to ewt, and was used as \"an ewt,\" but the \"n\" from the indefinite article (an) shifted to form a newt. Others place the change from \"an eft\" to \"a neft\" with the letter f eventually transformed to \"w.\""

        "During mating seasons, logs provide numbats an area for their nesting sites.",
        "Most importantly, the heartwood of the majority of trees in eucalypt woodlands are eaten by termites, which are the base of the numbat's diet.",
        "Because numbats are not powerful enough to break into termite mounds to get to their prey, they have to feed during the day when there is a great abundance of active termites in the shallow galleries.",
        "It uses a well-developed sense of smell to locate the shallow and unfortified underground galleries that termites construct between the nest and their feeding sites; these are usually only a short distance below the surface of the soil, and vulnerable to the numbat's digging claws.",
        "An adult numbat requires up to 20 thousands termites each day. The only marsupial fully active by day, the numbat spends most of its time searching for termites.",
        "Numbats produce a variety of vocalizations. During breeding season, if a female and male are both interested in one another, they vocalize by producing a series of soft clicks.",
        "Numbats breed in February and March (late austral summer), normally producing one litter a year. Gestation lasts 15 days, and results in the birth of four young. Unusually among marsupials, female numbats have no pouch, although the four teats are protected by a patch of crimped, golden hair and by the swelling of the surrounding abdomen and thighs during lactation.",
        "Numbats provide important ecological values as predators specialized on termites, while being preyed upon by carpet pythons, red foxes, eagles, hawks, and falcons.",

Although some populations are small and unstable, the Ocelot is widespread but the general population trend is now decreasing. This is mainly due to habitat loss as vast areas particularity in the Amazon, are subject to drastic deforestation and no longer provide the dense cover and adequate food supply that the Ocelot needs to survive.",

        "Bottom-dwelling octopuses eat mainly crabs, polychaete worms, and other molluscs such as whelks and clams. Open-ocean octopuses eat mainly prawns, fish and other cephalopods. Large octopuses have also been known to catch and kill some species of sharks. Seabirds have also been documented as prey.",
        "The octopus is well known for being a master of disguise and is able to blend into pretty much any background using its elaborate camouflage. The octopus not only uses this to its advantage for both hiding from potential prey and predators, but it is also thought to play a role in the male octopuses mating display, in order to attract a female octopus.",
        "Octopuses have several secondary defenses (defenses they use once they have been seen by a predator). The most common secondary defense is fast escape. Other defenses include distraction with the use of ink sacs and autotomising limbs \u2013 If predator grabs them for any tentacle, they will reject it. Soon after, new tentacle will grow.",
        "Octopuses move with a simple elegance, but they have no rhythm, unlike most animals.",

        "The olm breathes with external gills that form two branched tufts at the back of the head. They are red in color because the oxygen-rich blood shows through the non-pigmented skin. The olm also has rudimentary lungs, but their role in respiration is only accessory, except during hypoxic conditions.",
        "Because it inhabits permanently dark environments, the olm has developed non-visual sensory systems to better suit an aphotic lifestyle.",
        "Highly sensitive chemoreceptors allow olms to detect extremely low concentrations of organic material in the water.",
        "The olm also has the ability to register weak electric fields. Some behavioral experiments suggest that the olm may be able to use Earth's magnetic field to orient itself.",
        "Amazingly, the olm finds it only necessary to eat occasionally as it can survive for up to ten years without eating anything. When it does become hungry and is in the good fortune of having some food available, the olm will feast on other small invertebrates. This includes: snails, worms, larvae and aquatic insects.",
        "Olms are gregarious, and usually aggregate either under stones or in fissures.",
        "Olms reproduce by either laying eggs or giving birth to live young. Temperature appears to be the factor that determines which reproductive strategy is used, with colder water triggering the bearing of live young. Adults commonly produce two live larvae using the live-bearing strategy, whereas they may produce up to 70 eggs using the egg-laying strategy.",
        "On the IUCN Red List, the olm is listed as vulnerable because of its fragmented and limited distribution and ever-decreasing population.",

They also eat human food, table scraps, dog food and cat food. If it's edible and accessible, the opossum will eat it.",
        "Opossums are excellent tree climbers and spend much of their time aloft. They are aided in this by sharp claws, which dig into bark, and by a long prehensile (gripping) tail that can be used as an extra limb. Opossums nest in tree holes or in dens made by other animals.",
        "Between the months of January and October, opossums breed and give birth to up to two litters of 4-8 young \u2013 or joeys \u2013 each. The gestation period of a possum is about 13 days, after which time the joeys are born and must immediately claim one of 13 nipples inside the mother's pouch. Joeys remain inside the pouch for about 50 days, after which time they begin to exit the pouch and spend time on their mother's back. After about 100 days, young opossums split from their mothers to find their own home ranges.",

        "Besides in their natural environment, ostriches are often breed as farm animals because some people like to eat their meat, eggs or to wear fashion products made of their skin.",
        "Ostriches have a lifespan of 30 to 40 years in the wild and in captivity up to 75 years with around 50 years being typical.",
        "An ostrich's powerful, long legs can cover 3 to 5 meters (10 to 16 feet) in a single stride. These legs can also be used for self-defense. An ostrich will kick with a force mighty enough to kill a lion.",
        "Adult male ostriches have striking black-and-white plumage; immature birds and adult females have grayish brown feathers.",
        "The wings reach a span of about 2 meters (6 ft 7 in). Their main use along with the tail feathers, is for displays and courtship. To show dominance, an ostrich holds its head up high and lifts its wings and tail feathers; to show submission, the head, wings, and tail droop down.",
        "Ostriches are omnivores, which means they eat both vegetation and meat. They mostly eat plants, especially roots, leaves, and seeds, but they also munch on insects, snakes, lizards, or rodents that come within reach.",
        "Ostriches are diurnal, but may be active on moonlit nights.",
        "Male ostriches are called cocks or roosters, and females are called hens.",
        "Ostriches live in groups, which helps with defense. With their long necks and keen vision, they can see for great distances, so in a group at least one of them is likely to notice danger approaching.",
        "Ostriches sometimes gather in a large flock of 100 or more, but most flocks are smaller, usually about 10 birds. The group has a dominant male and a dominant female called the \"main hen\", and several other females. Lone males come and go during mating season.",
        "As a flightless species in the rich biozone of the African savanna, the ostrich must face a variety of formidable predators throughout its life cycle. Animals that prey on ostriches of all ages may include cheetahs, lions, leopards, African hunting dogs, and spotted hyenas.",
        "Contrary to popular belief, ostriches do not bury their heads in the sand. The old saw probably originates with one of the bird's defensive behaviors. At the approach of trouble, ostriches will lie low and press their long necks to the ground in an attempt to become less visible. Their plumage blends well with sandy soil and, from a distance, gives the appearance that they have buried their heads in the sand.",
        "As its species name, camelus, suggests, the ostrich was once known as the \"camel bird\" because of its long neck, prominent eyes, and sweeping eyelashes, as well as its jolting walk. Also, like camels, the ostrich can tolerate high temperatures and go without water for long periods of time.",
        "When family groups of ostriches meet, they may challenge each other with short chases, and then the winning adult pair takes all the chicks with them. Some of these \"nurseries\" can end up with 300 chicks and only a couple of adults to mind them.",
        "They once roamed all over Asia, Africa and the Arabian Peninsula, but because they have been hunted so extensively, wild ostriches' range has been reduced to sub-Saharan Africa.",
        "Ostriches have inspired cultures and civilizations for 5 thousands years in Mesopotamia and Egypt.",
        "In some countries, people race each other on the backs of ostriches. The practice is common in Africa and is relatively unusual elsewhere.",

        "Otters are adorable creatures that live both on land and in the water.",
        "Their sleek, streamlined bodies are perfect for diving and swimming. Otters also have long, slightly flattened tails that move sideways to propel them through the water while their back feet act like rudders to steer.",
        "Sea otters are good at floating on the water's surface, as air trapped in their fur makes them more buoyant.",
        "Almost all otters have webbed feet, some more webbed than others, and they can close off their ears and nose as they swim underwater.",
        "Average life span in the wild is up to 12 years except for sea otter who can live up to 20 years.",

        "Otters make lots of different sounds, from whistles, growls, and screams to barks, chirps, moans, and coos.",
        "Otters can stay submerged for five to eight minutes, depending on the species, because their heart rate slows, and they use less oxygen.",
        "Otters have a very high metabolism and have to eat a lot of food per day, or eat several times a day.",
        "River otters eat mostly fish, frogs, crayfish, crabs, and mollusks, with an occasional small mammal or bird.",
        "Sea otters eat many of the same things, but mostly sea urchins, abalone, crabs, fish, octopuses, mussels, and clams. They crack open clams and mussels with rocks they hold on their stomach\u2014the only otter species to use rocks as tools.",
        "An otter's den is called a holt or a couch.",
        "A group of otters are called a bevy, family, lodge, or romp, or, when in water the group is called a raft.",
        "For most otters, social groups are made up of a mother, her older offspring, and her newest pups; the males spend most of their time alone or with a few other males.",
        "During breeding time or where there's lots of food, though, larger otter groups may gather, especially among sea otters in kelp beds.",
        "Otters reach sexual maturity between 2 to 5 years.",
        "Gestation period is 2 months for some species to 6 months for sea otters.",
        "The female otter will usually have between 1 and 6 pups depending on the species.",

The mother takes care of the pups and they open their eyes and start exploring after about one month, at roughly two months they start swimming, and they stay with their mother and brothers and sisters until they are about 1 year old.",
        "Sea otter pups are born with their eyes open, and even though they are not able to swim they have a coat of hair that lets them float. Their mother carries them on her stomach for the first two months until they are ready to start swimming and diving on their own.",
        "For many generations, fishermen in southern Bangladesh have bred smooth-coated otters and used them to chase fish into their nets.",
        "Many species of otter are either threatened or endangered.",

        "Some types of oysters known as the \"true oysters\" are highly prized as food. They are consumed both raw and cooked. Some types of pearl oysters are harvested for the pearl produced within the mantle.",
        "Oysters have been around for a while. Estimates put the shellfish at around 300 million years old, at least.",
        "Oysters were originally cooked by fire as early humans had primitive tools that would have made it difficult to open oysters to eat raw. Archeologists believe that oysters were placed over fire or heated stones and cooked until the oysters opened up as oysters from the Mesolithic period show evidence of scorch marks from fire. The use of fire by early humans evidence back to about four hundred thousand years ago, so consumption of oysters most likely began after that time.",
        "The Stone Age, which was between 2.5 million years ago to 9600 BC, left behind fossilized oyster shells from many coastal civilizations, which demonstrated that oysters were an important part of the human diet for thousands of years.",
        "Oyster cultivation was invented by Sergius Orata, a Roman engineer also often credited with the invention of underfloor heating, and since his invention, oyster farming has become big business.",
        "In the United Kingdom, the town of Whitstable is noted for oyster farming from beds on the Kentish Flats that have been used since Roman times.",
        "Oyster sales boomed from the early 19th century onwards, and the shellfish were sold as street food across London, Paris, and New York as they remained a cheap and accessible snack to many. In 1860, the small British seaside town of Whitstable alone was sending 50 million tons of oysters to London each year, and by 1900, New York was eating 1 million oysters every day.",
        "By the 20th century, the overharvesting of oysters in the US and Europe was noticeable and it was difficult to maintain the oyster stock needed to meet demand.",
        "Oysters are still alive as you eat them! In fact, if you are going to eat an oyster raw, it has to be alive or else it will no longer be safe to eat. In the case of oysters, alive means fresh! Trust us, you only want to be eating oysters that are alive.",
        "Oysters are an excellent source of zinc, iron, calcium, and selenium, as well as vitamin A and vitamin B12.",
        "In the northern hemisphere, the old rule that native oysters should only be eaten when there's an 'r' in the month still holds true \u2013 so eat oysters from September to April. During the summer months they're busy spawning, and their flesh becomes unpleasantly soft and milky. Rock oysters are available all year round.",
        "The pearl oysters are well-known for producing large, commercially valuable pearls. Pearls form when an irritant \u2013 usually a parasite and not the proverbial grain of sand \u2013 works its way into an oyster, mussel, or clam. As a defense mechanism, a fluid is used to coat the irritant. Layer upon layer of this coating, called 'nacre', is deposited until a lustrous pearl is formed.",
        "In addition to their commercial importance for culinary purposes and for the production of pearls, oysters provide important ecological values. Oyster reefs provide habitat for many organisms, and the oysters themselves provide food for various fish, marine mammals, and invertebrates. As filter feeders, they have a remarkable ability to filter water, removing pollutants and excess nutrients.",

        "Pangolins have large, protective keratin scales covering their skin; they are the only known mammals with this feature.",
        "The pangolin's scaled body is comparable in appearance to a pine cone. It can curl up into a ball when threatened, with its overlapping scales acting as armor, while it protects its face by tucking it under its tail. The scales are sharp, providing extra defense from predators.",
        "The four Asian pangolins are distinguished from the African species by the presence of bristles which emerge from between the scales.",
        "Pangolins are insectivorous. Most of their diet consists of various species of ants and termites and may be supplemented by other insects, especially larvae. They are somewhat particular and tend to consume only one or two species of insects, even when many species are available to them. A pangolin can consume 140 to 200 g (4.9 to 7.1 oz) of insects per day.",
        "Pangolins have a very poor sense of vision, so they rely heavily on smell and hearing.",
        "Most pangolins are nocturnal animals that use their well-developed sense of smell to find insects. The long-tailed pangolin is active by day, while other species of pangolins spend most of the daytime sleeping, curled up into a ball. Pangolins are considered to be shy and secretive creatures.",
        "Pangolins are solitary and meet only to mate. While the mating season is not defined, they typically mate once each year, usually during the summer or autumn. Gestation periods differ by species, ranging from roughly 70 to 140 days. African pangolin females usually give birth to a single offspring at a time, but the Asiatic species may give birth from one to three.",
        "At the time of birth, the scales are soft and white. After several days, they harden and darken to resemble those of an adult pangolin. The baby is not able to walk for a few weeks, instead, it clings to the base of the mother's tail. Young pangolins are weaned at four months and are ready for life on their own at about five months of age.",
        "Leopards, hyenas, and pythons are pangolin predators.",

The prettier the peacock, the more peahens he attracts by strutting around and shaking his feathers. Once mating is done, the female bird gathers various materials to create a nest. Males look for other peahens to mate.",

        "At dusk, pelicans all settle down for the night. Their head rests back on their shoulders, their eyes close and their feathers ruffled against the cold.",
        "Pelicans are a large bird, which makes them harder prey for most predators in their natural environment. Because of this, most animals do not hunt them. However, a wounded pelican that cannot fly is easy prey for wild dogs, feral cats and larger mammals. Humans are also predators of the pelican, hunting them for their feathers and eating the meat.",

        "Penguins can dive further and swim faster than any other bird.",
        "Most penguins swim underwater at around 7 to 11 kilometers (4 to 7 miles) per hour, but the fastest penguin \u2013 the gentoo (Pygoscelis papua) \u2013 can reach top speeds of 35 kilometers (22 miles) per hour!",
        "Penguins are not able to breathe underwater; however, all of the penguin species can hold their breath for as long as 15 minutes.",
        "Emperor penguins are the undisputed champions of diving in the world of penguins. They can travel more than 500 meters (1 thousands feet) below the surface, and stay submerged for more than 20 minutes, even though by all accounts their oxygen should run out in just a fraction of that.",
        "Penguin's black and white plumage serves as camouflage while swimming. The black plumage on their back is hard to see from above, while the white plumage on their front looks like the sun reflecting off the surface of the water when seen from below.",
        "A penguin's eyes are adapted to see clearly both in air and under water. Penguins have color vision and are sensitive to violet, blue, and green wavelengths of light and possibly to ultraviolet light as well.",
        "At sea penguins must drink salt water and they are able to do this because they have special glands abound the eye sockets that extract excess salt from the blood. The excess salt is excreted as a salty fluid through the nasal passages.",

        "A chick depends on its parents for survival between hatching and the growth of its waterproof feathers before it can fledge (leave the colony to go forage at sea.) This period may range from seven to nine weeks for Ad\u00e9lie chicks to 13 months for king penguin chicks.",
        "Penguin calls (vocalizations) are individually identifiable, allowing mates to recognize each other and also their chick. This is important because members of a large colony of penguins are nearly indistinguishable by sight.",
        "Approximately 1 in 50 thousands (of most species) are born with brown rather than black plumage. These are called isabelline penguins. Isabellinism is different from albinism. Isabelline penguins tend to live shorter lives than normal penguins, as they are not well-camouflaged against the deep, and are often passed over as mates.",
        "Land predators of the various penguin species include lizards, skuas, snakes, other birds and ferrets. Water predators consist largely of killer whales, leopard seals and sharks.",
        "According to the Red List of Threatened Species from the International Union for Conservation of Nature, four penguin species are endangered: northern rockhopper, erect-crested, yellow-eyed, jackass and Galapagos penguins. Most of the other species of penguins are listed as vulnerable or threatened.",

        "The male and female have similar markings and plumage, but as in many birds of prey the peregrine falcon displays marked sexual dimorphism in size, with the female measuring up to 30% larger than the male.",
        "The peregrine falcon's coloration helps it to blend into its environment. The back and the long pointed wings of the adult are usually bluish black to slate grey with indistinct darker barring; the wingtips are black. The white to rusty underparts are barred with thin clean bands of dark brown or black. The tail, colored like the back but with thin clean bars, is long, narrow, and rounded at the end with a black tip and a white band at the very end.",

        "According to a National Geographic TV program, the highest measured speed of a peregrine falcon is 389 km/h (242 mph).",
        "The most common prey for peregrine falcons is other birds. In fact, other birds make up 77% to 99% of their diet! Birds eaten include pigeons and doves, shorebirds, waterfowl, ptarmigan, grouse, and relatives, and smaller songbirds. The most common prey item are pigeons and doves.",
        "Peregrine falcons use a wide variety of vocalizations at different stages of life, but primarily during breeding seasons.",
        "The peregrine falcon became an endangered species in many areas because of the widespread use of certain pesticides, especially DDT. Since the ban on DDT from the early 1970s, populations have recovered, supported by large-scale protection of nesting places and releases to the wild.",
        "The peregrine falcon has been listed as a species of \"least concern\" by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) since 2015.",

        "Platypuses can swim through fast waters at the speed of around 1 meter per (3.3 feet) second, but when foraging the speed is closer to 0.4 meters (1.3 feet) per second. Dives normally last around 30 seconds, but can last longer, although few exceed the estimated aerobic limit of 40 seconds. Recovery at the surface between dives commonly takes from 10 to 20 seconds.",
        "The average sleep time of a platypus is said to be as long as 14 hours per day, possibly because it eats crustaceans, which provide a high level of calories.",
        "Duck-billed platypuses are solitary, especially males. If the territories of males overlap, they change their foraging time to avoid each other.",
        "Outside the mating season, the platypus lives in a simple ground burrow, the entrance of which is about 30 cm (12 in) above the water level. After mating, the female constructs a deeper, more elaborate burrow up to 20 m (66 ft) long and blocked at intervals with plugs.",
        "Platypuses are one of the three mammal species that lay eggs. They generally lay two to three eggs. Estimated gestation periods are 27 days and incubation periods are 10 days. Lactation lasts three to four months.",
        "Predators of duck-billed platypuses include foxes, humans, and dogs. Others are snakes, birds of prey, feral cats, and large eels.",
        "The duck-billed platypus is the most evolutionary distinct mammal alive today and a member of the most primitive order of mammals on Earth, Monotremata.",

Hunters wanted their dogs to have free range of movement in the water, but they also wished to protect vital areas of the anatomy from the cold. They shaved the legs, neck, and tail but left the chest, hips, and leg joints coated. The rounded tufts on the legs, hips, and tail tip are called pompons.",

        "Porcupines are very vocal during mating season and the gestation period is about 7 months. Porcupine babies, called porcupettes, are not born with sharp or barbed quills. Instead, the porcupette's quills are soft and bendable, gradually hardening in the first few days after birth. The youngsters stay with their mother for just a few months before they are ready to live on their own.",
        "Fishers are a primary predator of porcupines, but quills have been found embedded in coyotes, pumas, bobcats, foxes, lynx, bears, wolves and even Great Horned Owls. These predators kill a porcupine by biting its unprotected face or by flipping it over to expose the vulnerable underside.",

Their raspy tongues and spiny palates allow them to firm grasp 10 to 12 fish during one foraging trip. They thus can bring more food back to their young compared with other seabirds that tend to swallow and regurgitate meals for their chicks. ",

        "With 6 million alive today puffins are not classed as an endangered species, populations in some places are in decline. The main threats are over-fishing, which can lead to a shortage of food for puffins, and pollution \u2013 particularly oil spills. Not only does the oil make these beautiful birds sick, it destroys their waterproof feathers, essential for their survival.",

Along this line, Ann was granted a patent by the United States Patent Office on December 19, 1975, and registered with the state of California April 16, 1975.",
        "Many of the early owners and breeders rebelled against being franchised and wanted no part of such an arrangement. The Daytons had bought their Ragdolls prior to this time and refused to go along with this new franchise concept. As a result of Ann's actions, several owners decided that they no longer wanted to be involved with Ann and began to break away from her.",

        "Rats have numerous ways of communicating with each other, the most common being body language. They have excellent hearing, and they communicate with each other by producing and recognizing meaningful ultrasound frequencies that humans cannot hear. They also communicate by touch, by smell, and by sound at frequencies that we can't hear.",
        "Rats are expert at navigating the world in the dark using their sense of touch. They rhythmically brush and tap about 60 large vibrissae (whiskers) against objects to determine object size, shape, orientation, and texture. This behavior is called \"whisking.\"",

        "Rats are careful eaters. To avoid eating something that might make them sick, wild rats are used to \"sampling\" or trying tiny amounts of foods to make sure they can digest it properly.",
        "Rats get a bad rap for being ugly, dirty and mean animals, but they're actually quite clean and caring animals. They can spend several hours a day cleaning and grooming themselves In fact, rats are less likely than dogs or cats to catch and transmit parasites and viruses.",
        "Rat reproduction has been most intensively studied in the brown rat. This prolific rodent reaches sexual maturity at three months and may produce up to 12 litters of 2 to 22 young (8 or 9 is usual) per year, with peaks in the spring and autumn and a gestation period of 21 to 26 days.",

        "Rattlesnakes get their name from special structures on the tip of their tail. Their \"rattle\" is made of rings of keratin (the same material our fingernails are made of). When vibrated, the rattle creates a hissing sound that warns off potential predators. It is an extremely effective and highly evolved predator-avoidance system.",
        "Rattlesnakes are pit vipers \u2014 they have heat sensing organs located in pits near the eyes. The heat-sensitive pits detect the prey's heat, and nerves transmit this information to the same area in the brain that receives optic nerve impulses. It is accurate to say the rattlesnake \"sees\" a heat image of its prey, and it can strike in darkness if the prey is even slightly warmer than its background.",
        "Rattlesnakes have an exceptionally keen sense of smell. They can sense olfactory stimuli both through their nostrils and by flicking their tongues, which carry scent-bearing particles to the Jacobson's organs in the roof of their mouths.",
        "All rattlesnakes are venomous. Some are more venomous than others: the species and habitat of the snake determines how potent its venom is and can vary within a single species.",
        "The rattlesnake's fangs inject venom into its prey when it strikes at a speed of about five-tenths of a second!",

        "Rattlesnakes mainly feed on small mammals and birds. They also eat snakes such as other rattlesnakes and garter snakes, lizards, frogs and large insects such as grasshoppers.",
        "Rattlesnakes only look for food when they're hungry. An adult rattler goes about two weeks between meals, on average, depending on how large its last meal was. Younger rattlesnakes eat more often, about once a week.",
        "Almost all reptiles, including rattlesnakes, are cold-blooded. As cold-blooded creatures, rattlers depend on the sun to warm them up to optimal temperatures and shady places to cool off.",
        "Those in more temperate zones, where temperatures can drop to 4\u00b0C (40\u00b0F), enter a period of brumation, in the winter which is dormancy similar to hibernation. To keep from freezing, rattlesnakes congregate in dens and form swarming balls with their bodies.",
        "Rocky crevices, burrows, and leaf litter all make safe dens for rattlesnakes.",
        "Rattlesnakes often return to the same den, year after year, sometimes traveling several miles to get there.Most rattlesnake species mate during the summer or fall, while some species mate only in the spring, or during both the spring and fall.",
        "Rattlesnakes are ovoviviparous. This means they give birth to live young after developing and retaining the eggs inside their bodies. Most of the time there are 8 to 10 babies born at once.",
        "Rattlesnakes generally take several years to mature, and females usually reproduce only once every three years.",

        "Red foxes are highly adept hunters, and have the necessary senses to help them in their endeavors. Their senses of smell, vision and hearing are all strong.",
        "The red fox is mostly nocturnal, although it will sometimes venture out in the day. The red fox, unlike other mammals, hears low-frequency sounds very well. It can hear small animals digging underground and will frequently dig in the dirt or snow to catch prey. The fox stalks its prey, much like a cat.",
        "A 2008\u20132010 study of 84 red foxes in the Czech Republic and Germany found that successful hunting in long vegetation or under snow appeared to involve an alignment of the fox with the Earth's magnetic field.",
        "Although the red fox tends to kill smaller predators, including other fox species, it is vulnerable to attack from larger predators, such as wolves, coyotes, jackals and medium- and large-sized felines.",
        "Because of its widespread distribution and large population, the red fox is one of the most important furbearing animals harvested for the fur trade.",
        "Too small to pose a threat to humans, it has extensively benefited from the presence of human habitation, and has successfully colonised many suburban and urban areas. Domestication of the red fox is also underway in Russia, and has resulted in the Domesticated red fox.",

        "In significantly cold temperatures, red pandas can become dormant, lowering their metabolic rate and raising it every few hours to wake up and look for food. This adaptation has allowed them to spend almost as little energy as a sloth, which is exceptionally beneficial considering the low nutrition content of their diet.",
        "Red pandas are generally quiet, but at close proximity subtle vocalizations such as squeals, twitters and huff-quacks can be heard. They may also hiss or grunt.",
        "Like giant pandas, they have an extended wrist bone that functions almost like a thumb and greatly aids their grip. When descending a tree head-first, the red panda rotates its ankle to control its descent, one of the few climbing species to do so.",
        "Claws are for climbing, of course, but this mild-mannered animal can defend its territory by standing on its hind legs and using those sharp claws to strike out if threatened. If that doesn't work at keeping enemies at bay, the red panda can release a strong odor from scent glands at the base of the tail that may make a predator think twice about a red-panda meal.",
        "Fully grown red pandas are preyed on by clouded leopards and snow leopards, while smaller red panda cubs are hunted by hawks, owls and other birds. The main predators of red pandas are humans, which sometimes still hunt red pandas for their skins and furs, but also threaten their existence through the destruction of their habitats.",
        "The red panda is the only living species of the genus Ailurus and the family Ailuridae. It has been previously placed in the raccoon and bear families, but the results of phylogenetic research provide strong support for its taxonomic classification in its own family Ailuridae, which along with the weasel, raccoon and skunk families is part of the superfamily Musteloidea.",

        "The adult saiga stands about 61 to 81 centimeters (24 to 32 inches) at the shoulder and weighs 31 to 43 kilograms (68 to 95 pounds). The head-and-body length is typically between 100 and 140 centimeters (39 and 55 inches).",
        "The most outstanding feature of the saiga is its swollen snout with downward-directed nostrils. The snout serves to warm and moisten inhaled air; it may be related to the animal's keen sense of smell, and it may also work as a sounding chamber for rutting calls. The complex saiga nasal cavity resembles that of a whale!",
        "The saiga's coat is short and pale brown in summer and thick and whitish in winter.",
        "While the sense of hearing is poorly developed in the saiga, their sense of sight is acute and they are able to see danger up to a kilometer (0.6 mile) away.",

        "Around half of all the world's salamander species are listed as Threatened by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).",
        "Legends have developed around the salamander over the centuries, many related to fire. This connection likely originates from the tendency of many salamanders to dwell inside rotting logs. When placed into a fire, the salamander would attempt to escape from the log, lending to the belief that salamanders were created from flames.",

        "Salmon appearance varies greatly from species to species. They can be silvery, greenish covered with black spots or/and stripes.",
        "Typically, salmon are anadromous, meaning they hatch in fresh water, migrate to the ocean, then return to fresh water to reproduce. The journey made by those salmon that survive this quest to reproduce is one of nature's greatest triumphs.",
        "The salmon must swim hundreds miles, to get back to the stream where they hatched. Whilst many simply do not have enough fat stores to make the trip, others must battle through fishermen's nets, over power dams, up waterfalls and rapids, and struggle past eagles, otters and bears to reach their destination.",
        "Salmons change the color of the body on their way from the ocean to the freshwater habitats during the mating season. They may also grow a hump, develop canine-like teeth, or develop a kype (a pronounced curvature of the jaws in male salmon).",
        "Salmon spend between 1 and 7 years out in the ocean, depending on the species.",
        "They come back to the stream where they were 'born' because they 'know' it is a good place to spawn; they won't waste time looking for a stream with good habitat and other salmon.",
        "Scientists believe that salmon navigate by using the Earth's magnetic field like a compass. When they find the river they came from, they start using smell to find their way back to their home stream. They build their 'smell memory-bank' when they start migrating to the ocean as young fish.",
        "Unlike Pacific salmon, Atlantic salmon do not die after spawning, so adults can repeat the migration and spawning pattern several times, although most spawn only once or twice.",
        "To lay her roe, the female salmon uses her tail, to create a low-pressure zone, lifting gravel to be swept downstream, excavating a shallow depression, called a redd. The redd may sometimes contain 5 thousands eggs covering 2.8 square meters (30 sq ft). [Photo below: Eggs in different stages of development]",
        "Young salmon feed on terrestrial and aquatic insects, amphipods, and other crustaceans while young; adults eat primarily other fish and also squid, eels, and shrimp. Unlike all other salmon, the sockeye salmon has a diet that consists almost entirely of plankton.",
        "There are diverse predators of salmon at the varying stages of their lives. Other fish, members of their own species, snakes and birds eat salmon fry. Once in the ocean, salmon are prey to whales, dolphins, seals, sea lions, other fish and, of course, humans. Bears and birds often scoop up spawning salmon.",
        "Many species of salmon have been introduced into non-native environments such as the Great Lakes of North America and Patagonia in South America.",

        "A variant method of fish stocking, called ocean ranching, is under development in Alaska. There, the young salmon are released into the ocean far from any wild salmon streams. When it is time for them to spawn, they return to where they were released, where fishermen can catch them.",
        "Salmon is a popular food. Classified as an oily fish, salmon is considered to be healthy due to the fish's high protein, high omega-3 fatty acids, and high vitamin D.",
        "Smoked salmon is a preparation of salmon, typically a fillet that has been cured and hot or cold smoked. Due to its moderately high price, smoked salmon is considered a delicacy.",

        "Samoyeds can compete in dog agility trials, carting, obedience, showmanship, flyball, tracking, mushing and herding events.",
        "Samoyeds aren't exactly cheap, although they are relatively reasonably priced by purebred standards. Most Samoyeds cost between $600 and $1500. However, some \u2013 especially those from award-winning bloodlines \u2013 may cost $3 thousands or more. Samoyeds are generally considered one of the more expensive dog breeds you can buy."

After freeing itself, the immature scorpion crawls onto the mother's back, where it remains for a periodranging from 1 to 50 days. During this time the young scorpions are defenseless and utilize food reserves in their bodies while receiving water transpired through the mother's cuticle and taken up through their own.",
        "Scorpions are unusual long lived compared to other invertebrates. Most scorpions reach maturity in 1 to 3 years (some species take longer time), and live for 2 to 5 years as adults. This means that scorpions can live from 3 to 8 years.",

        "Adult sea turtles have a few predators, mostly large sharks. Tiger sharks, in particular, are known for eating sea turtles. Killer whales have been known to prey on leatherback turtles. Fish, dogs, seabirds, raccoons, ghost crabs, and other predators prey on eggs and hatchlings.",
        "5 of the 7 species are endangered with the Olive Ridley considered vulnerable while the status of the Flatback is unknown.Slaughtered for their eggs, meat, skin and shells, sea turtles suffer from poaching and over-exploitation. They also face habitat destruction and accidental capture in fishing gear. Climate change has an impact on turtle nesting sites.",

        "There are around 50 different species of seahorses.",
        "Seahorses' ability to change their color and shape makes identification of individual species challenging. Because of this, some researchers previously thought there were as many as 200 seahorse species in the world, while others thought there were as few as 20.",
        "Seahorses are mainly found in shallow tropical and temperate waters throughout the world, and live in sheltered areas such as seagrass beds, estuaries, coral reefs, or mangroves.",

        "Seahorses feed on plankton, small fish and small crustaceans such as shrimp and copepods. An adult eats 30-50 times a day. Seahorse fry (baby seahorses) eat a staggering 3000 pieces of food per day.",
        "Most wild seahorses are monogamous and some species mate for life.",
        "Searching for mates can be difficult and risky since seahorses are poor swimmers, found in low densities and rely on camouflage to hide from predators.",
        "Seahorse couples greet each other every morning with a unique dance that sometimes involves changing color. The couple promenades and pirouettes together for several minutes before separating for the rest of the day. They greet each other as a way to confirm the other partner is still alive, reinforce their bond and synchronize their reproductive cycles.",

        "All seals share some general physical characteristics. They all have streamlined bodies for moving through the water and four flippers. Their bodies are covered in soft fur, and under their skin all seals have a layer of blubber which helps insulate them from cold temperatures. However, seals that live in colder climates have more blubber than those that live in warmer climates, even within the same species of seal.",
        "Seals spend most of their lives in the water.",
        "Most seal species live in very large social groups called colonies that may come together to sunbathe in masses of hundreds, and take to the beach to mate and raise young in tightly packed gatherings of thousands.",
        "Seals hunt alone or in groups. Their specialized bodies allow them to hunt for food in the water effectively. Their fins give them the ability to move very rapidly through the water, and seals can also dive deep into the ocean. Seals also have whiskers that are highly sensitive to movements and vibrations, making them effective hunters during the day or night.",
        "Seals feed mainly on fish, but shellfish, squid and octopus also feature prominently in their diet. Seals are usually opportunistic feeders and are willing to eat most meat that is available depending on the location. They're considered to be predatory carnivores, and although most seals eat a vast variety of ocean creatures, some species eat only specific prey, such as crustaceans or krill. And a few, like the leopard seal, feed on large vertebrates, such as penguins and other seals.",
        "Depending on the type of seal, they can dive at least 300 meters (1 thousands feet). Some of them can dive up to 900 meters (3 thousands feet). It is believed they can go deeper than that if necessary for food. The deepest recorded dive of a seal is 2 thousands meters (7 thousands feet) by a southern elephant seal.",
        "Seals dive for three minutes at a time typically, and most species can stay under water up to 30 minutes. But champion divers, such as elephant seals, can hold their breath for about 2 hours.",
        "Seals can sleep both in the water and on land, making it easier for them to choose whatever's best for their situation to avoid dangers. Scientists have recorded them sleeping for minutes at a time while slowly drifting downward in a belly-up orientation. Like other marine mammals, seals sleep in water with half of their brain awake so that they can detect and escape from predators. When they are asleep on land, both sides of their brain go into sleep mode.",

        "Servals are found in several habitats. They are common on savannas where there is plenty of water. Servals prefer areas of bush, tall grass, and dry reed beds near streams, but they are also found in high-altitude moorlands and bamboo thickets. They are known to occur up to 3 thousands meters (12 thousands ft) above sea level on Mount Kilimanjaro.",
        "The average lifespan for servals is about 10 years in the wild, and up to 20 years in captivity.",
        "The serval stands 54 to 62 cm (21\u201324 in) at the shoulder and weighs 8 to 18 kg (18\u201340 lb). The head-and-body length is typically between 67 and 100 cm (26\u201339 in).",
        "Serval are slender cats with long legs, a lean body, a short tail, and a small head.",

        "The serval has a varied diet, eating rodents, birds, reptiles, frogs, fish, and large insects.",
        "The serval has capability of leaping 3 meters (10 feet) in the air to catch birds and insects in flight. But small rodents are its most frequent prey item, and a serval doesn't hesitate to reach a long leg down into a rodent's burrow to snatch a meal out of the tunnel! Ultrasonic hearing ability allows the serval to hear the high-pitched communication of rodents. The cat's long, curved claws can also hook fish and frogs right out of the water.",
        "With its many hunting styles, varied diet, and fantastic hearing, the serval is well equipped to be the most successful predator of all the cats.",
        "The serval is active in the day as well as at night; activity might peak in early morning, around twilight and at midnight. Servals might be active for a longer time on cool or rainy days. During the hot midday, they rest or groom themselves in the shade of bushes and grasses.",
        "Like many cats, the serval is able to purr; it also has a high-pitched chirp, and can hiss, cackle, growl, grunt and meow.",
        "Servals have no major predators other than humans. Leopards and hyenas are the most probable competitors for food and territory. When African servals discover they are close to an individual of a rival species, they run away in confusing darting leaps.",

        "Sharks have prowled Earth's seas, essentially unchanged, for 400 million years.",
        "The majority of shark species live 20 to 30 years in the wild, there are some species that live much longer than others. For example, the Greenland shark has the longest lifespan at about 400 years, while the blue shark in the wild has an average lifespan of 15-16 years.",
        "They range in size from the small dwarf lanternshark (Etmopterus perryi), a deep sea species of only 17 centimeters (6.7 inches) in length, to the whale shark (Rhincodon typus) [photo below], the largest fish in the world, which reaches approximately 12 meters (40 feet) in length.",
        "Most sharks are \"cold-blooded\", meaning that their internal body temperature matches that of their ambient environment.",
        "Sharks belong to a family of fish that have skeletons made of cartilage, a tissue more flexible and lighter than bone.",
        "Like other fish, sharks extract oxygen from seawater as it passes over their gills. Unlike other fish, shark gill slits are not covered, but lie in a row behind the head.",
        "All sharks have multiple rows of teeth, and while they lose teeth on a regular basis, new teeth continue to grow in and replace those they lose.",
        "Sharks have a covering of placoid scales that protects their skin from damage and parasites in addition to improving their fluid dynamics.",
        "Sharks have all the senses we have (smell, taste, touch, eyesight, and hearing). They can also sense electricity and vibrations in the water.",
        "A shark's primary sense is a keen sense of smell. Its paired nostrils are on the underside of its snout. Water continually flows through the nostrils, giving the shark olfactory information. Unlike humans, shark nostrils have nothing to do with breathing \u2013 they are not even connected to the mouth.",

        "Although it is hard to test the hearing of sharks, they may have a sharp sense of hearing and can possibly hear prey from many miles away. Sharks have only an inner ear, which consists of three chambers and an ear stone called an otolith. A shark's inner ear detects sound, acceleration, and gravity.",
        "Sharks are opportunistic feeders, but most sharks primarily feed on smaller fish and invertebrates. Some of the larger shark species prey on seals, sea lions, and other marine mammals. Sharks have been known to attack humans when they are confused or curious.",
        "Sharks may be social or solitary animals living on their own, depending on the species. Since they are equipped with teeth at birth, they do not need to rely on each other for survival.",
        "Sharks traveling in groups are most common during mating season and periods of migration, though some species also tend to hunt together in groups.",
        "Most sharks give birth to live young, but some release eggs that hatch later. The gestation period can be up to almost two years long.",

        "Some captive female sharks have been known to reproduce without the aid of a male, essentially cloning themselves.",
        "Oxygen-rich water flows through the gills during movement allowing the shark to breathe. While some species of sharks do need to swim constantly, this is not true for all sharks. Some sharks such as the nurse shark have spiracles that force water across their gills allowing for stationary rest.",
        "In general, sharks swim (\"cruise\") at an average speed of 8 kilometers (5 miles) per hour, but when feeding or attacking, the average shark can reach speeds upwards of 19 kilometers (12 miles) per hour. The shortfin mako shark, the fastest shark and one of the fastest fish, can burst at speeds up to 50 kilometers (31 miles) per hour.",

The dominance hierarchy of sheep and their natural inclination to follow a leader to new pastures were the pivotal factors in sheep being one of the first domesticated livestock species.",
        "Sheep establish a dominance hierarchy through fighting, threats and competitiveness.",
        "Sheep follow a similar reproductive strategy to other herd animals. A group of ewes is generally mated by a single ram, who has either been chosen by a breeder or has established dominance through physical contest with other rams. After mating, sheep have a gestation period of about five months; most lambs born in mid spring. One or two lambs, which are able to stand and suckle within a few minutes of birth, are born to each ewe.",

        "Tree squirrels live in woodlands and forests in both arid and humid environments. Tree squirrels are the types most commonly recognized, often seen gracefully scampering and leaping from branch to branch.",
        "The last group, the ground squirrels, mostly occupies open land that includes grasslands and tundra. They dig burrows, a system of tunnels underground, to live in.",
        "The smallest is the African pygmy squirrel at 7\u201310 centimeters (2.8\u20133.9 inches) in length and just 10 grams (0.35 ounce) in weight.",
        "The largest (by length) is the Indian giant squirrel at 1 meter (39 inches) in length and weighs up to 2 kilograms (4.41 pounds).",
        "Adult squirrels can have a lifespan of 5 to 10 years in the wild.",
        "Ground and tree squirrels are typically diurnal or crepuscular, while flying squirrels tend to be nocturnal.",
        "Squirrels are predominantly herbivorous. They eat mostly nuts, fruits, and seeds, but they sometimes eat insects, small birds, and other creatures.",
        "The squirrel is an industrious fellow, known for thinking ahead and setting aside food caches to see him through the winter months. He works hard, foraging for food and transporting it for storage, often burying his finds underground to retrieve later in the winter. Tree squirrels and flying squirrels have to carry their food, but the ground squirrel has an advantage: he's the only squirrel with cheek pouches.",
        "Squirrels are extremely intelligent creatures. They are known to put on elaborate bogus food burying displays to deceive onlookers. The fake burials are to trick potential thieves, such as other squirrels or birds, into thinking that they have stored their food stock there. Any observers planning on taking the stash will then focus on the bogus burial site, allowing the squirrel to bury the real stash elsewhere safely.",
        "Squirrels don't dig up all of their buried nuts, which results in more trees!",
        "Like other rodents, squirrels have four front teeth that never stop growing so they don't wear down from the constant gnawing.",
        "As their large eyes indicate, in general squirrels have an excellent sense of vision, which is especially important for tree-dwelling species.",
        "Squirrels communicate with each other through various vocalisations and scent marking. They also use their tails as a signalling device, twitching it when uneasy to alert other squirrels of potential danger.",
        "Squirrels tend to run in erratic paths. This is intended to deceive potential predators as to its chosen direction so that it may escape.",
        "There are many animals that hunt and eat squirrels. Some of the predators that eat squirrels include: badgers, bobcats, cats (feral), coyotes, eagles, falcons, foxes, hawks, lynx, owls, pine martins, raccoon, skunks, snakes, weasels, wolverines, and humans.",
        "Squirrels breed once or twice a year and give birth to two to eight offspring after three to six weeks, depending on species.",
        "Squirrels are very trusting animals, and are of the very few wild animal species which will eat out of a person's hand.",
        "Some squirrel species can smell food buried underneath 30 centimeters (1 foot) of snow. They dig tunnels and follow the smell until, eureka! A treasure trove of snacks.",
        "Flying squirrels can glide up to 90 meters (295 feet), making it look like they can fly.",
        "The oldest squirrel fossil ever found is the Hesperopetes, which dates back to the late Eocene period. Among rodents, these were most closely related to the mountain beaver and the dormouse.",
        "The squirrel is the Native American symbol for preparation, trust and thriftiness.",
        "That word \"squirrel\", first attested in 1327, comes from the Anglo-Norman esquirel which is from the Old French escurel, the reflex of a Latin word sciurus. This Latin word was borrowed from the Ancient Greek word \u03c3\u03ba\u03af\u03bf\u03c5\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2, skiouros, which means shadow-tailed, referring to the bushy appendage possessed by many of its members."

        "They can vary widely in size, with the paddle-spined starfish as small as 1 centimeter (0.4 inch) wide and the Midgardia xandros topping 1.38 meters (4.5 feet) across.",
        "Starfish have no brains and no blood. Their nervous system is spread through their arms and their \"blood\" is actually filtered sea water.",
        "Although they are named \"starfish\", they are not related to fish at all. Starfish, like sea urchins and sand dollars, do not have backbones, which makes them part of a group called invertebrates.",
        "While they can't see as well as we do, starfish have an eye spot at the end of each arm. This is a very simple eye that looks like a red spot. The eye doesn't see much detail, but can sense light and dark.",
        "The underside of the starfish is covered with hundreds of tube feet, which it uses for walking around, for attaching tightly to rocks, and for holding on to prey. To move, each tube foot swings like a leg, lifting up and swinging forward, then planting itself on the ground and pushing back.",
        "Starfish eat in a very strange way. The starfish's mouth is on the bottom of its body. The mouth is at the middle of the star. A starfish can push its stomach out through its mouth.",
        "Although they are able to regenerate detached arms and some detached arms can grow into new starfish, most species reproduce by spreading and fertilizing eggs.",
        "The female starfish is capable is releasing over 2 million eggs at any one time, although the average amount of eggs that the female starfish releases is closer to 1 million. This is important because small portion of the eggs survive to become adult starfish.",
        "The eggs released by the female starfish are then fertilized by the male starfish and the fertilized eggs develop into larvae which are able to swim around. Starfish larvae [pic. below] swim for about three weeks before settling and beginning metamorphosis into the more common appearance of the starfish.",
        "Starfish reproduction typically is heterosexual, but hermaphroditism (reproductive organs of both sexes in one animal) occurs.",
        "Starfish can change their gender when it's convenient for them and can easily change back to their original sex.",
        "Starfish, despite their crusty exteriors, are vulnerable to predators like crabs, sea otters, sharks, manta rays and other starfish.",
        "Starfish aren't social creatures, but some species will congregate in large groups during certain times of the year to feed.",
        "Common feature for all starfish is that their body is radially symmetrical (regular arrangement of body parts around a central axis) .",
        "With their appealing symmetrical shape, starfish have played a part in literature, legend, design and popular culture.",
        "With its multiple arms, the starfish provides a popular metaphor for computer networks, companies and software tools.",
        "Starfish are sometimes eaten in China, Japan and in Micronesia.",
        "The fossil record for starfish is ancient, dating back to the Ordovician around 450 million years ago, but it is rather poor, as starfish tend to disintegrate after death.",
        "The starfish is today considered to be a threatened species of animal mainly due to habitat loss and pollution Swhich are drastically reducing the starfish populations."

        "Stick insects are found in all continents except Antarctica. They are most numerous in the tropics and subtropics.",
        "Over 300 species are known from the island of Borneo, making it the richest place in the world for stick insects.",
        "Their natural range is very broad; they occur at high and low altitudes, in temperate and tropical temperatures and in dry or wet conditions. Stick insects generally live in trees and bushes, but some species live entirely on grassland.",
        "Like any insect, stick insects have a three-part body (head, thorax and abdomen), three pairs of jointed legs, compound eyes and one pair of antennae.",
        "Stick insects very in size from 1.5 centimeters (0.6 in) to about 60 centimeters (24 in) in length; males are typically much smaller than females.",
        "In 2014 a new species of stick insect in southern China has been declared the world's longest insect. The 62.4-centimeter (24.6-inch) long creature beats the previous record holder, another stick insect discovered in 2008 (and named Phobaeticus chani or Chan's megastick) by nearly 6 centimeters (2.4 inches).",
        "Stick insects generally mimic their surroundings in color, normally green or brown, although some may be black, gray, or even blue.",
        "When camouflage is not enough, some stick insects use active forms of defense to handle predators. For example, the species Eurycantha calcarata can release an awful-smelling substance as a deterrent. Other species have brightly colored wings that are invisible when folded against their body; when they feel threatened, they flash open their wings, then immediately drop to the ground and again hide their wings.",
        "Stick insects are mainly nocturnal creatures, spending much of their day motionless, hidden under plants, helping them avoid many predators.",
        "Stick insects are herbivores meaning that the diet of the stick insect is purely a vegetarian one. Stick insects mainly feed on leaves and other green plants. Some are very specialized, feeding only upon a favored plant species. Others are generalists.",
        "One of the most interesting facts about stick insects is their ability to reproduce parthenogenetically. This is a form of asexual reproduction where the unfertilized females produce eggs that hatch into females. If a male fertilizes the egg, it has a fifty-fifty chance of turning out male. If no males are around, the line continues with females only.",
        "The lifespan of stick insects varies by species, but ranges from a few months to up to three years.",
        "Stick insects, unfortunately for them, can provide a lot of nourishment to a handful of different predator types. Common predators for these insects include primates, spiders, rodents, reptiles and birds. Bats are also a prominent and serious predation threat for these insects.",
        "Stick insects first appeared in the fossil record over 40 million years ago and they are related to cockroaches, praying mantises, and, more distantly, the grasshoppers and crickets.",
        "Many stick insects are easy to care for, and make good pets. Almost 300 species have been reared in captivity. The most commonly kept is the Indian (or laboratory) stick insect, Carausius morosus, which eats vegetables such as lettuce.",
        "Research has been conducted to analyze the stick insect method of walking and apply this to the engineering of six-legged walking robots. Instead of one centralized control system, it seems each leg of a phasmid operates independently."

        "A stingray have lifespan between 15 and 25 years in the wild.",
        "The river stingrays, and a number of whiptail stingrays (such as the Niger stingray), are restricted to fresh water.",
        "Stingrays are disk-shaped and have flexible, tapering tails armed, in most species, with one or more saw-edged, venomous spines. Most stingrays have one or more barbed stings on the tail, which is used only for self defending.",
        "Stingrays typically have mottled skin that looks similar to the colors found on the sea floor. Their colors differ based on species and where they typically live, ranging from a light sand color to a darker, spotted brown for more rocky areas.",
        "Stingrays settle on the bottom while feeding, often leaving only their eyes and tail visible.",
        "The flattened bodies of stingrays allow them to hide themselves. Stingrays agitate the sand and hide beneath it.",
        "Because their eyes are on top of their bodies and their mouths on the undersides, stingrays cannot see their prey after capture; instead, they use smell and electroreceptors (ampullae of Lorenzini) similar to those of sharks.",
        "Some stingrays' mouths contain two powerful, shell-crushing plates, while other species only have sucking mouth parts.",
        "Stingrays feed on mollusks, worms, crustaceans, fish, clams, crabs, and shrimps.",
        "When they are inclined to move, most stingrays swim by undulating their bodies like a wave; others flap their sides like wings.",
        "Many stingrays like to live by themselves and only come together for breeding and migration.",
        "Stingrays are ovoviviparous. This means they give birth to live young after developing and retaining the eggs inside their bodies. They have \"litters\" of 5 to 13 young.",
        "Stingrays present a majestic view as they glide through the water, almost like they're flying. However, most species of stingray spend the majority of their time hiding from predators and waiting on feeding opportunities to present themselves. When they decide to go for a swim, they could become the next tasty meal of a variety of predators.",
        "Stingray's predators include large fishes, especially sharks. Stingray spines have been found embedded in the mouths of many sharks. The great hammerhead Sphyrna mokarran, in particular, appears to specialize in eating stingrays. It uses its hammer head to knock a ray to the bottom, and then pins the ray, once again with its head, pivoting around to bite the ray's disc until the ray succumbs and can be eaten.",
        "They lash their tails when stepped on, and large stingrays can exert enough force to drive their tail spines into a wooden boat. The spines cause serious, extremely painful wounds that, if abdominal, may result in death.",
        "Rays are edible, and may be caught as food using fishing lines or spears. Stingray recipes abound throughout the world, with dried forms of the wings being most common.",
        "Stingray species are progressively becoming threatened or vulnerable to extinction, particularly as the consequence of unregulated fishing.",
        "In ancient Greece, venom was actually extracted from stingray spines for the purpose of being used as an anesthetic by dentists.",

        "The average lifespan of a stoat is 1 to 2 years, and the maximum is 7 years.",
        "In summer the stoat is brown, with a whitish throat, chest, and belly. In colder climates the winter coat is white, except for the black tail tip. In moderately cold climates the fur becomes only partly white.",
        "The stoat's lithe, agile body allows it to move swiftly both above ground and through underground burrows.",
        "Stoats are carnivores that hunt primarily at night. They eat mostly small rodents, and in particular mice, voles, and lemmings. Stoats will also eat squirrels, rabbits, insects, birds and their eggs, and sometimes fish, reptiles, amphibians, and invertebrates.",
        "Stoats live alone and are territorial. They mate once a year and have several babies, which are called kits. The kits may not develop for 8-9 months after the female becomes pregnant. When weather conditions are good and there is plenty of food, the kits begin to grow and are born within a month.",
        "Stoats are fierce and aggressive, although diminutive, animals. Potential predators are larger carnivores including red fox, gray fox, martens, fishers, badgers, raptors, and occasionally domestic cats.",
        "The root word for \"stoat\" is likely either the Dutch word stout (\"naughty\") or the Gothic word \ud800\udf43\ud800\udf44\ud800\udf30\ud800\udf3f\ud800\udf44\ud800\udf30\ud800\udf3d (stautan, \"to push\").",
        "The stoat is classed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) as least concern, due to its wide circumpolar distribution, and because it does not face any significant threat to its survival.",
        "In the late 19th century, stoats were introduced into New Zealand to control rabbits, where they have had a devastating effect on native bird populations.",
        "In Irish mythology, stoats were viewed anthropomorphically as animals with families, which held rituals for their dead.",
        "In the Zoroastrian religion, the stoat is considered a sacred animal, as its white winter coat represented purity.",

        "Most sturgeons are anadromous bottom-feeders which migrate upstream to spawn but spend most of their lives feeding in river deltas and estuaries.",
        "Many sturgeon leap completely out of the water, usually making a loud splash which can be heard half a mile away on the surface and probably further under water. It is not known why they do this, but suggested functions include group communication to maintain group cohesion, catching airborne prey, courtship display, or to help shed eggs during spawning.",
        "Sturgeons are valued for their flesh, eggs, and swim bladder. Their flesh is sold fresh, pickled, or smoked. Caviar consists of the eggs, which are stripped from ripe females who are subsequently released.",
        "Almost all caviar is harvested from dead fish. Fishermen on the Caspian wait until the mature female sturgeon (which are at least 10 years old) are ready to migrate upstream and lay their eggs. Once caught, the sturgeon will be transferred to a large boat, where workers slit her open and remove her eggs. The caviar is cleaned to prevent spoilage and then packed up; the rest of the fish is sold for flesh.",
        "The largest commercial sturgeon fisheries are in southern Russia, Ukraine, and Iran, though the industry is also carried on in the United States and western Europe.",

        "The natural lifespan of a tapir is approximately 25 to 30 years, both in the wild and in zoos.",
        "The Malayan tapir (Tapirus indicus) is the largest species of tapir; it is from 1.8 and 2.5 meters (5 ft 11 in and 8 ft 2 in) in length; 90 to 110 centimeters (2 ft 11 in to 3 ft 7 in) in shoulder height; and weight between 250 and 320 kilograms (550 and 710 pounds).",

        "After a gestation period of 13 months, the female tapir gives birth to a single tapir baby (twins are rare), called a calf.",
        "Even though there are differences in habitat and geography, all tapir calves look like brown- and beige-striped watermelons on legs. The pattern is good for camouflage, but they lose the stripes as they get older.",
        "Young tapirs nurse as long as the mother provides milk or until she is ready to have another offspring.",
        "Adult tapirs are large enough to have few natural predators, and the thick skin on the backs of their necks helps to protect them from threats such as jaguars, pumas, crocodiles, anacondas, and tigers.",

        "Threats to Tasmanian devils include attacks by domestic dogs and foxes, being hit by cars, loss of habitat, and disease.",
        "In the 1990s, the total Tasmanian devil population was estimated at 130 thousands to 150 thousands. However, the population has been in continual rapid decline since then.",
        "Tragically, since the mid-1990s, a catastrophic disease has killed thousands of Tasmanian devils. Called devil facial tumor disease (DFTD), this fatal condition is a rare contagious cancer that causes lumps to form around the animal's mouth and head, making it hard for it to eat. Scientists are working hard to find a way to stop the spread of DFTD before it wipes the species out.",
        "According to an assessment made in 2008, when the Tasmanian devil was put on the red list of endangered species, there are about 10 thousands to 25 thousands mature Tasmanian devils left in the wild.",
        "The Tasmanian devil is probably best known internationally as the inspiration for cartoon character the Tasmanian Devil, or \"Taz\". He featured in the Warner Bros. \"Looney Tunes\" and \"Merrie Melodies\" series of cartoons. Though the character appeared in only five shorts before Warner Bros. Cartoons closed down in 1964, marketing and television appearances later propelled the character to new popularity in the 1990s."

        "The tawny owl typically nests in a hole in a tree, but will also use old European magpie nests, squirrel drey or holes in buildings, and readily takes to nest boxes. The typical clutch of two or three glossy white eggs is incubated by the female alone for 30 days to hatching, and the altricial, downy chicks fledge in a further 35\u201339 days. The young usually leave the nest up to ten days before fledging, and hide on nearby branches. The parents care for young birds for two or three months after they fledge.",

The largest recorded specimen taken under International Game Fish Association rules was caught off Nova Scotia, an area renowned for huge Atlantic bluefin, and weighed 679 kg (1 thousands lb) and 3.7 m (12 ft) long.",
        "Tunas are highly specialized migrating species. They swim continuously to counterbalance their negative buoyancy, travelling hundreds of kilometers / miles. This strategy has a high energy cost, forcing them to move in search of food and has resulted in morphological and physiological adaptations for thermoregulation and high oxygen extraction efficiency. Therefore, temperature and dissolved oxygen concentration affect tuna behavior significantly.",
        "Tunas have a well-developed network of blood vessels below the skin that acts as a temperature-regulating device associated with long-term, slow swimming. Because of this vascular system, they are able to maintain the temperature of their bodies above that of the surrounding water, often between 5 and 12 \u00b0C (9 and 21.7 \u00b0F) above ambient water temperature.",
        "An active and agile predator, the tuna has a sleek, streamlined body, and is among the fastest-swimming pelagic fish \u2013 the yellowfin tuna, for example, is capable of speeds of up to 75 km/h (47 mph).",
        "The tuna will swim near the surface of the ocean to look for food, however they can also dive to the depth of 900 meters (3000 feet) to search for their next meal.",

        "Walruses climb up on ice or beaches to sleep or to rest. They move awkwardly on land but are swift in the water.",
        "Walruses usually swim at an average speed of 7 km/h (4.3 mph), but are able to swim as fast as 35 km/h (21.7 mph).",
        "Walruses generally breathe at the surface for about one minute after every five to eight minutes of subsurface activity. They can stay submerged for as long as 10 minutes.",
        "A walrus's bottom-dwelling prey usually inhabit waters no more than about 80 m (262 ft) deep: a walrus generally dives no deeper than this. But most feeding probably takes place between 10 and 50 m (33 and 164 ft).",
        "Because visibility is poor in deep and murky waters, walruses rely on their whiskers to locate food.",
        "Walruses prefer molluscs \u2013 mainly bivalves such as clams. They also eat many other kinds of invertebrates including worms, gastropods, cephalopods, crustaceans, sea cucumbers, and other soft-bodied animals. Walruses may occasionally prey on fishes such as polar cod.",
        "Adult walruses eat about 3% to 6% of their total weight per day. They may eat as many as 3 thousands to 6 thousands clams in a single feeding session.",
        "Research has shown that the walrus is a very social type of creature. In fact, they are among the most gregarious of animals. Walruses are almost always found in large herds no matter what they are doing. It is extremely rare that you will find a walrus by itself.",
        "Walruses communicate through auditory and visual displays.",
        "Walruses are among the most vocal of the pinnipeds. They produce growls, taps, knocks, grunts, barks, soft whistles, rasps, and clicks. Male walruses produce bell-like sounds below water. These sounds are not produced by the vocal cords but originate from air sacs, which extend from the pharynx.",
        "During courtship, males display visually and vocally from the water. Males will mate with multiple females in one mating season, while females only mate approximately every two years. This results in walruses having the lowest reproduction rate of all the pinnipeds.",
        "Due to its great size and tusks, the walrus has only two natural predators: the killer whale (orca) and the polar bear. Adults use their giant tusks as a weapon to defend themselves. The young walruses are more susceptible to predation.",
        "In the 18th and 19th centuries, the walrus was heavily exploited by American and European sealers and whalers, leading to the near extirpation of the Atlantic population. Commercial walrus harvesting is now outlawed throughout its range, although Chukchi, Yupik and Inuit peoples are permitted to kill small numbers towards the end of each summer.",
        "Currently, two of the three walrus subspecies are listed as \"least-concern\" by the IUCN, while the third (Laptev walrus) is \"data deficient\".",
        "The walrus plays an important role in the religion and folklore of many Arctic peoples. Skin and bone are used in some ceremonies, and the animal appears frequently in legends.",
        "The walrus's scientific name, Odobenus rosmarus, is Latin for \"tooth-walking seahorse.\""

        "The warthog has an average lifespan of 12 to 18 years.",
        "The warthog is a medium-sized species, with a head-and-body length ranging from 0.9 to 1.5 metres (3 to 5 feet), and shoulder height from 63.5 to 85 cm (2 to 2.8 ft).",
        "Warthogs are remarkable for their strength, intelligence, and flexibility!",
        "Warthogs are not picky eaters. They'll gobble up grass, roots, berries, tree bark and occasionally also eat small animals.",
        "A warthog can go without water during Africa's dry season (which can last for several months). During that period they survive only from water from the plants they eat.",
        "When water is available, warthogs will seek it and often submerge to cool down. They will also wallow in mud for the same purpose\u2014and to gain relief from insects. Birds also aid these hogs in their battle with insects; oxpeckers and other species sometimes ride along on their warthog hosts, feeding on the tiny creatures invading their hides.",
        "As you might suspect when you look at their big snout, warthogs are good sniffers. It's easy for them to smell things underground that they might want to eat. Warthogs often kneel down on their front legs and use their muscular snout to dig up dinner. They even shuffle along in the kneeling position if there are plenty of tasty things in the area.",
        "Warthogs mate once a year during the 'rut' (annual mating season), where boars find females by visiting their burrows. Males fight for the females by pushing, interlocking tusks and hitting each other in the face or the sides of their body.",
        "Unlike many of their African counterparts, they are not endangered. This is because they are so skilled at adapting to new threats. For example, most warthogs like to forage during the light of the morning and early evening. But if they live in an area where people hunt them, they switch to foraging at night.",
        "Lions, cheetahs, leopards, African wild dog, hyenas, and eagles all like to snack on a warthog when they get a chance.",
        "Warthogs are iconic animals of the African savanna, so they can contribute to ecotourism.",

        "There are over 120 thousands species of wasps.",
        "Wasps live all around the world and are found in nearly every country.",
        "The largest social wasp is the Asian giant hornet [photo below], at up to 5 centimeters (2.0 in) in length; among the largest solitary wasps is a group of species known as tarantula hawks also up to 5 cm (2.0 in) long, along with the giant scoliid of Indonesia which have a wingspan of 11.5 cm (4.5 in).",
        "The smallest wasps are solitary chalcid wasps in the family Mymaridae, including the world's smallest known insect, with a body length of only 0.139 mm (0.0055 in), and the smallest known flying insect, only 0.15 mm (0.0059 in) long.",
        "Wasps have biting mouthparts and antennae with 12 or 13 segments. They are normally winged. In stinging species, only the females are provided with a formidable sting, which involves use of a modified ovipositor (egg-laying structure) for piercing and venom-producing glands.",
        "Some wasp species are similar to bees. They are distinguishable from bees by their pointed lower abdomens and narrow \"waist,\" a petiole, that separates the abdomen from the thorax. They also have little to no hair on their bodies (as opposed to bees) and don't play much of a role in the pollination of plants. Their legs are shiny, slender, and shaped like cylinders.",
        "Social wasps account for only about a thousand species and include commonly known colony-builders, like yellow jackets and hornets.",
        "All wasps that are not parasitic build nests. The vast majority of solitary wasps make their nest in the ground. Social wasps create their familiar papery nests from wood fibers scraped with their hard mandibles and chewed into a pulp.",
        "By far the greater number of wasps (over 100 thousands species) are a special type of parasite. They are parasitoids which lay their eggs in or on the caterpillars of other insect species. Unlike true parasites, the wasp larvae eventually kill their hosts.",
        "Most wasps live less than one year, some workers for just a few months. Queens several live for several years.",
        "A wasps' diet varies amongst species, generally speaking a wasps larvae will almost always get its first meal from within a host insect. Adult solitary wasps mainly feed on nectar, but the majority of their time is taken up by foraging for food for their carnivorous young, mostly insects or spiders. Some social wasps are omnivores, eating both plants and other animals. They often eat fruit, nectar and carrion such as dead insects.",
        "Social wasps use chemicals to identify nest-mates and send warnings and other information. Parasitic wasps sometimes leave scent marks on the host insects to tell any other parasitic wasps that they've already laid eggs there.",
        "Unlike bees, female wasps have the ability to sting a target multiple times because their stinger does not fall off after use.",
        "Social wasps use their stingers only for defense, stinging solitary wasps rely on their venom to hunt.",
        "While wasp stings deter many potential predators, bee-eaters specialise in eating stinging insects, making aerial sallies from a perch to catch them, and removing the venom from the stinger by repeatedly brushing the prey firmly against a hard object, such as a twig.",
        "Almost every insect pest species has at least one wasp species that preys upon it or parasitizes it. This makes wasps critically important in the natural control of pest numbers. Parasitic wasps are increasingly used in agricultural pest control as they themselves do little or no damage to crops. Farmers buy these parasitic wasps for insect control in their fields.",
        "While the vast majority of wasps play no role in pollination, a few species can effectively transport pollen and pollinate several plant species. For example fig wasps are the only pollinators of nearly 1000 species of figs.",
        "Wasps have been modelled in jewellery since at least the nineteenth century, when diamond and emerald wasp brooches were made in gold and silver settings.",
        "A fashion for wasp waisted female silhouettes with sharply cinched waistlines emphasizing the wearer's hips and bust arose repeatedly in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.",

Two types are recognized, based on morphological and behavioural criteria \u2013 the river buffalo of the Indian subcontinent and further west to the Balkans and Italy, and the swamp buffalo, found from Assam in the west through Southeast Asia to the Yangtze valley of China in the east.",
        "There are 74 breeds of domestic water buffalo numbering some 165 million animals, but only small numbers of wild water buffalo remain.",
        "The water buffalo is the \"living tractor of the East.\" It is not rare to find buffalo that continue to work well at the age of 30, and instances of a working life of 40 years are recorded.",
        "In general, water buffalo are found in lower elevations, but in Nepal, swamp buffalo can commonly be found at elevations of 2 thousands meters (9 thousands meters). Domesticated animals are widespread, and therefore are found in a wide variety of habitats. The majority of the domesticated water buffalo are found in agricultural communities, but they can also be found in many cities.",
        "Water buffalo is a ruminant and is predominately a grazer on grasses. It also eats herbs, aquatic plants, leaves, agricultural crops, and various other vegetation that grows in or along rivers and streams.",
        "Like cattle, domestic water buffalo have many uses.",
        "Water buffalo and the African Cape buffalo diverged from yaks and bison about three million years ago.",
        "Wild water buffalo are now very rare. It is thought that less than 4 thousands remain and their numbers are declining. Some of the problems are illegal hunting, loss of habitat, introduced diseases and parasites, and interbreeding with domesticated buffalo.",
        "Tigers are the only other predator on water buffalo, though water buffalo are challenging prey even to so large a cat. When confronted by a tiger, water buffalo often stand together as a herd and charge together in a line. They are usually successful at driving tigers off, and water buffalo have been known to kill tigers with their horns. Tigers often have their success stalking single animals and focusing on juveniles.",

        "Weasels vary in length from 17 to 22 centimeters (6.8 to 8.5 in), females being smaller than the males. Their tails may be from 3.5 to 5.2 centimeters (1.3 to 2.0 in) long; The average weasel weighs about 200 grams (7 ounces).",
        "Weasels have brown to yellow-brown fur with paler fur on the belly. The tip of the tail is often black. Many weasels grow white fur in the winter, but the tip of the tail remains black.",
        "Weasels are active in both winter and summer; they do not hibernate.",
        "Aside from when they are mating or weaning young, weasels are solitary animals that fend for themselves in the wild.",
        "Weasels are ferocious predators. Their senses of sight, smell and hearing are acute, their hunting instinct is keen, and they are active, aggressive and quick.",
        "Weasels are carnivores who eat over 40% of their own body weight each day. They eat small mammals (like mice, squirrels, lemmings, rabbits, and hares), birds, frogs, lizards, insects, carrion (dead meat that they find).",
        "Weasels often kill more prey than they can eat, storing the overkill for later consumption.",
        "Male weasels mate with multiple females and do not provide parental care. Most species have a single litter per year. Litter size varies from 3 to 8 kittens. The young are born after a gestation period of anywhere from 35 days to more than 10 months, the latter because of delayed implantation of the fertilized egg.",
        "Young Weasels develop remarkably quickly and are not only weaned by the time they are two months old, but are also able to hunt small prey and will leave their mother within the next few weeks to establish a territory of their own.",
        "Despite their fast and dexterous nature, the small size of Weasels means that they are preyed upon by a number of different predators throughout their natural range. Birds of Prey such as owls, hawks and eagles that are able to spot them from high in the sky are the most common predators of the weasel, along with foxes and snakes.",
        "A group of weasels can be called a boogle, gang, pack, and confusion.",
        "The least weasel is the world's smallest mammalian carnivore.",

        "Weasels, stoats, and even domesticated ferrets all perform a hilarious \"weasel war dance\" when they've got their prey cornered. Scientists aren't totally sure why they do this. One theory is that the weasel's wacky twisting, hopping, and darting around distracts, confuses, or even hypnotizes prey animals.",
        "The English word \"weasel\" was originally applied to one species of the genus, the European form of the least weasel. This usage is retained in British English, where the name is also extended to cover several other small species of the genus.",
        "Weasels have been assigned a variety of cultural meanings.",
        "In Greek culture, a weasel near one's house is a sign of bad luck, even evil, \"especially if there is in the household a girl about to be married\", since the animal (based on its Greek etymology) was thought to be an unhappy bride who was transformed into a weasel and consequently delights in destroying wedding dresses. In neighboring Macedonia, however, weasels are generally seen as an omen of good fortune.",

        "The Cardigan Welsh Corgi has been attributed to the influences of Nordic settlers in the region. Dogs of similar dimensions exist in modern Scandinavia, called the Swedish Vallhund, and it is claimed by some historians that these two breeds share a common ancestor.",
        "In the late 19th century, farmers in began to switch from cattle to sheep but the corgi is not suited for working sheep. Similarities between the Welsh Corgis have been attributed to cross-breeding between the two, or simply selected breeding from those who wished to have the Cardigan variety appear closer in nature to the Pembroke.",
        "The first recorded date for Corgis appearing in the show ring in Wales is 1925. Captain J. P. Howell called together a meeting of breeders of both the Pembroke and the Cardigan varieties, and formed the Welsh Corgi Club, with an initial membership of 59 members.",

        "Whale sharks are known to gather at a dozen major feeding locations around the world, from western Australia and Indonesia to Belize. But between May and September, the waters of Mexico's Quintana Roo state, on the northeastern Yucatan Peninsula, draw far more animals than other spots and attract an estimated 800 or more in a given season.",
        "After years of tagging and tracking, researchers are in agreement on one important discovery: whale sharks will return to nutrient-rich feeding areas in subsequent years.",
        "Much of the sharks' lives seem to occur in the open sea, where they're hard to observe, leaving chunks of their lives a mystery. For instance, no one has ever seen whale sharks mate.",
        "Whale sharks become sexually mature at the age of 30. Females are ovoviviparous, which means that females produce eggs, but the young hatch inside of the mother instead of in the water like most fish. Then, the female gives birth to about 300 live young. Newborns are 40 to 60 centimeters (16 to 24 inches) long.",

The English word \"white\" is said to have been derived by mistranslation of the Dutch word \"wijd\", which means \"wide\" in English. The word \"wide\" refers to the width of the rhinoceros's mouth. So early English-speaking settlers in South Africa misinterpreted the \"wijd\" for \"white\" and the rhino with the wide mouth ended up being called the white rhino and the other one, with the narrow pointed mouth, was called the black rhinoceros."

        "Wildebeest usually breed at the end of the rainy season when the animals are well fed and at their peak of fitness. This usually occurs between May and July, and birthing usually takes place between January and March, at the start of the wet season. The calves weigh about 21 kg (46 lb) at birth and scramble to their feet within minutes, being able to move with the herd soon afterwards, a fact on which their survival relies.",
        "Major predators that feed on wildebeest include the lion, hyena, African wild dog, cheetah, leopard, and crocodile, which seem to favour the wildebeest over other prey. Wildebeest, however, are very strong, and can inflict considerable injury even to a lion.",

        "The Serengeti is the site of what most consider the most dramatic migration, with giant herds of millions of animals\u2014some 200 thousands zebras and 1.2 million wildebeests as well as gazelles and eland\u2014traveling from the Ngorongoro area in southern Tanzania to the Masai Mara in lower Kenya and returning as the rains dictate.",
        "Zebra foals are born after an 12 to 13 month gestation period. They have soft, fuzzy fur, and their stripes are usually brown and white at first. The young zebra is able to stand shortly after birth and able to walk within 20 minutes of birth and can run after only an hour. This is important, since the mare needs to move with the herd to find food and water.",
        "Foals must be able to recognize their mother from birth in order to survive. A foal learns its mother's stripe pattern in order to follow her. Zebra foals begin to change to adult colouration after 4 months. Although a foal may graze within a week of birth, they continue to suckle for up to 16 months.",
        "It was previously believed that zebras were white animals with black stripes, since some zebras have white underbellies. Embryological evidence, however, shows that the animal's background color is black and the white stripes and bellies are additions."
