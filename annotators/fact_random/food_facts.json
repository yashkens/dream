Reason tends to prove this theory, which anyone can check out, quite simply, in the following way : milk left to the open air, naturally transforms itself through the effects of germs, which make it coagulate and ferment. As far as Yogurt is concerned, it is easy to isolate the main cause of fermentation in the organisms present in the animal skins used as containers.",

After heating, the milk is allowed to cool to about 45 \u00b0C (113 \u00b0F).

    "The box jellyfish is unique because it has 24 eyes, four parallel brains, and 60 anal regions. Two of its eyes can see color. It is also one of the animals in the world that has a 360-degree view of its surroundings.",
    "Jellyfish don't breathe in a typical fashion, as they have no respiratory system; their ultra-thin membranes are able to diffuse oxygen into their cells from the water around them. Because of their physical makeup, jellyfish actually require much less oxygen than many other sea creatures.",
    "Jellyfish use stinging cells on their tentacles to both capture food and protect themselves from predators. These stinging cells penetrate flesh like minuscule darts and remain active even after the animal is dead.",

Instead, the best thing to do is get out of the water immediately, and wash the affected with salt water (NOT fresh water). Salt water will deactivate the stinging cells, while fresh or tap water will reactivate them. The best way to remove the cells is with something such as a credit card.",

Then, in the late 1940s, modernization began: taphole-drilling equipment was mechanized \u2013 sanitary methods were adopted for handling sap \u2013 precision instruments were developed for making syrup \u2013 provision was made for sap to be transported from the tapholes of entire areas of sugar bush (sugar maple stands) to storage tanks via plastic tubing \u2013 and central evaporator plants were established to serve whole communities of sap producers.",

    "Today, butter and margarine are very similar in terms of taste, appearance, price, and even calories.",
    "The main difference between butter and margarine is what type of fat each contains. Butter tends to contain more saturated fat, since it's made from animal fat. Margarine, on the other hand, usually contains unsaturated fats, since it's made from vegetable oils. These unsaturated fats help to reduce low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, which is what health professionals consider to be \"bad\" cholesterol.",
